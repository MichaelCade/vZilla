It&rsquo;s seems my content was viewed a lot more as well compared to previous years so much so I decided to summarise the key areas and focus points on the vZilla website. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">How many posts???<br /></h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      The majority of my posts in 2015 were around my key technologies VMware, NetApp, Cisco and Veeam. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    As I said in the introduction I have made an extra effort to contribute within the community and using my blog as well as my twitter and LinkedIn accounts to reach the wider areas. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    You can see from the stats below that the since I started the page in 2013 there has been some steady growth I would like to think I can hit that extra 5-6 posts during 2016 to continue sharing my thoughts and technical findings. <br /><span style=""></span>        </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="../../../uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/489780_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:752px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">Visitor Stats<br /></h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      One thing I did keep an eye on this year are the web site statistics, quite interesting to see the amount of hits and visits that the site took but also the top viewed blog posts. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="../../../uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/8263979_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:884px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      I have since moved over to AWstats for my statistics capture for 2016, looks a little more in depth and much more modern. From the chart above the key stats are the monthly visits, showing May and October, November being the chart topping months. The overall highest visits was 5550 visits and that was from May, May saw a couple of posts one around a release of NetApp OnCommand Shift and also a post around Veeam FastSCP for Microsoft Azure. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">Top 3 Blog Posts<br /></h2>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="../../../uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/3041383.jpg@309" alt="Picture" style="width:auto;max-width:100%" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      Moving onto the most visited blog posts were as follows: <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    1 &ndash; November 13th &ndash; 1562 visits &ndash; Cisco Appliances Post <br /><span style=""></span>2 &ndash; February 26th &ndash; 1525 visits &ndash; FlexPod 101 &amp; OpenStack Fundamentals <br /><span style=""></span>3 &ndash; November 12th &ndash; 1504 visits &ndash; NetApp Insight <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    <a title="" style="" href="http://bit.ly/1jrb6fD">http://bit.ly/1jrb6fD</a> - Cisco &amp; Veeam Appliance &ndash; A Match Made In&hellip;. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <a title="" style="" href="http://bit.ly/1UMg8jf">http://bit.ly/1UMg8jf</a> - FlexPod 101 <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <a title="" style="" href="http://bit.ly/1MWO7EM">http://bit.ly/1MWO7EM</a> - OpenStack Fundamentals<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <a title="" style="" href="http://bit.ly/1k7sk1A">http://bit.ly/1k7sk1A</a> - NetApp Insight 2015 - Las Vegas<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <a title="" style="" href="http://bit.ly/1QktV1r">http://bit.ly/1QktV1r</a> - NetApp Insight 2015 - Berlin<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <a title="" style="" href="http://bit.ly/1OXmTQJ">http://bit.ly/1OXmTQJ</a> - Veeam FastSCP for Microsoft Azure <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <a title="" style="" href="http://bit.ly/1O3UqoB">http://bit.ly/1O3UqoB</a> - AltaVault + Veeam - Backup to the Cloud&hellip; <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <a title="" style="" href="http://bit.ly/1NPIDdD">http://bit.ly/1NPIDdD</a> - Appliances, Appliances Everywhere&hellip; Veeam &amp; NetApp E-Series <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <a title="" style="" href="http://bit.ly/1GJZCgz">http://bit.ly/1GJZCgz</a> - NetApp Storage Snapshots with Veeam <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <a title="" style="" href="http://bit.ly/1IZeCJS">http://bit.ly/1IZeCJS</a> - 2015 A Year in Review<br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">Twitter - @MichaelCade1<br /></h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      It&rsquo;s been another busy year for me on Twitter, but I have so much to thank to the platform, not only is it the best form of research and it is so informative, it works really well to my lifestyle and it allows me to share my content as well as digest others. Having started on twitter in February of 2009 I was a very slow user but soon came to find the great use case for the platform and it was 2015 where I hit the 10,000 tweets and also the 1200 followers mark. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Not to mention the continued advocate programs that I am apart of, without twitter I would not be involved in any. This year saw the addition of the Cisco Champion class of 2015 and I was also accepted in the latter part of the year to the vExpert2015 club. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="../../../uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/183536.png@384" alt="Picture" style="width:auto;max-width:100%" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      One of the top tweets I had this year with well over 250 engagements on twitter and getting a great shout out from @CiscoGeeks after some data centre work that I was carrying out. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="../../../uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/8034146.png@303" alt="Picture" style="width:auto;max-width:100%" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      The final stats I want to share are for the whole year and spread out over the months. Again something I have only started collecting so next year we will get something to compare to but hopefully it&rsquo;s an upward growth. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    3,167 tweets throughout the year &ndash; Just under 9 tweets a day<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  10,728 Twitter profile views &ndash; <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  498k Twitter Impressions &ndash; Impressions explained and why they are important - <a style="" href="https://www.hashtags.org/platforms/twitter/understanding-twitter-impressions-why-are-they-important/">https://www.hashtags.org/platforms/twitter/understanding-twitter-impressions-why-are-they-important/</a> <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    511 new followers &ndash; With the total of followers up to 1,268 that to me seems like some considerable growth in 2015 compared to since 2009. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="../../../uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/995826.png@494" alt="Picture" style="width:auto;max-width:100%" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      Next year I am hoping I can better all of these numbers, but the key to this is sharing with the community, as long as the content I am putting out there is being digested by one or more people then it&rsquo;s worth doing in my opinion. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    One regret possibly I do have for 2015 is announcing the beginning of VDM30in30, that&rsquo;s 30 posts in 30 days, the likelihood of this was very slim given the busy events period during November. I did have a list of posts though well above 30 that I thought would be interesting so that sets us in good stead for 2016. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    I have a content list for 2016 that I will be working through to ensure content is valuable. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div></div><div class='blog-social'><div class='blog-social-item'><a class='twitter-share-button' href='http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvzilla.co.uk%2F1%2Fpost%2F2016%2F01%2Fvzilla-website-social-media-stats.html' data-count='horizontal'></a></div><div class='blog-social-item blog-fb-like'><fb:like href='http://vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2016/01/vzilla-website-social-media-stats.html' show_faces='false' layout='button_count' width='90'></fb:like></div><div style='clear:both'></div></div>

</div><div class='blog-separator'> &nbsp; </div><div class='blog-content'><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      2015 &ndash; A Year in Review<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    My first post of 2016 is going to have a quick look back over 2015, from my own career perspective and also the industry as a whole. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    <strong>Starting with Veeam </strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    At the end of March 2015 I joined the Veeam team and I have not looked back, just short of a year now and I have to say I love it. Vendor land, Pre Sales and systems engineering a year ago was a little unknown to me, having worked in a predominantly post sales capacity it was a big step into the unknown but I knew I wanted to give it a shot and see how I faired. I am really enjoying things and here are some of the things that have stood out for me over the last 10 months. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    <strong>1st Quarter (April &ndash; June)</strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    First thing was to go through the on boarding process, having worked with Veeam before it was a nice advantage to have during the on boarding sessions. I was also very fortunate, that as part of the NetApp A-Team, I was able to visit Sunnyvale for the annual ETL event where the whole team met up and got to hear some insights into what is happening at NetApp over the short and long term. To sum up the first quarter it was more about getting to know my colleagues at Veeam and a lot of finding my feet with the product features and processes. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    <strong>2nd Quarter (July &ndash; September) </strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    This was where the fun really started for me, I have never been in a Sales driven environment before, aiming for numbers and being so close to the sale. This was my first quarter and I have to say, I loved it! Delivering demos and proof of concepts to end users and seeing it through from the initial meeting to a PO was a great feeling. One of the biggest deals I was involved with was for a UK Service Provider, they were refreshing their existing Infrastructure as a Service offering with Veeam Cloud Connect and becoming a Veeam VCSP partner. I was involved from start to finish from a technical aspect, seeing this come to fruition was a great milestone for me. To top this quarter off, I received the MVP award within the UK SE team which was a great surprise and honour after only being with Veeam 6 months. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    <strong>3rd Quarter (September &ndash; December) </strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    My third quarter saw the events season. Again something I have not been involved with from this side of the fence I have been to many events as a technical person but not actually speaking or on stand duty. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Veeam ON Tour &ndash; Here I was given the chance to co present with my manager at all four events! Live demos would have been our preference but due to some flaky internet connections, we had to fall back on the canned demos I had prepared. The four locations for 2015 were Manchester, London, Edinburgh and Dublin. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    NetApp Insight, Las Vegas &ndash; Again, I was fortunate to visit the annual US event in Las Vegas hosted by NetApp, as part of the NetApp A-Team. Here I not only took on the technical sessions but also took part in other media opportunities. A real highlight was &ldquo;Engineers Unplugged&rdquo; with Cisco alongside my Veeam colleague, Shawn Lieu. This is yet to be published, I&rsquo;ll link when this comes online to view!<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    NetApp Insight, Berlin EMEA &ndash; Stand Duty &ndash; I have been to many Insight conferences but until 2015 had never done &ldquo;stand duty&rdquo;, so this was new to me but I really enjoyed it! I managed to get to some technical sessions on the first day and in between stand duty, I was also able to get involved in some advocate tasks. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    IP Expo, London &ndash; This is another regular event for me, but again never on stand duty or as a guest speaker. This was a totally new experience for me, having a speaking slot was a great and I expect there will be many more in 2016! <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    With all this going on I still had a pre-sales job to do, so this meant a lot of time away from my family, scheduling meetings in and around these events. With the feature announcements throughout the year of version 9, we were also busy with What&rsquo;s new demos etc. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    All in all, 3 great quarters with Veeam and I have a feeling it&rsquo;s only going to get better and better going into 2016; My calendar is already getting quite packed with meetings, conferences and events. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    <strong>Review 2015 predictions &ndash; </strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    At the start of 2015 I followed suit with what seemed to be the entire tech industry, creating prediction blogs for the year ahead, here is the link to that blog - <a style="" href="http://vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2015/03/2015-the-year-of-the.html">http://vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2015/03/2015-the-year-of-the.html</a><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    &ldquo;The continuance growth of adoption to Hybrid Cloud&rdquo; <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    I am not going to get into detail about each prediction but I think the continuance of Hybrid Cloud adoption did continue but probably not at the speed I and others though for 2015. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    &ldquo;Flexibility will be the biggest issue facing the storage industry&rdquo; <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Flexibility, again goes hand in hand with the hybrid cloud adoption and being able to easily move data in and out and all around different environments. I believe the tools are growing in maturity and it&rsquo;s now down to the end users to embrace and start leveraging this technology. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    &ldquo;Software Defined &hellip;&rdquo; <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    I think in my opinion this is an area where there as been a lot of hype around Software Defined but quite little traction and user take up. The biggest one for me this year was around Software Defined Networking and understanding at a very 101 level what this was doing and how this was abstracting the physical network. Again an Industry buzz word that I am sure will continue to be branded in 2016. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    &ldquo;Flash&rdquo; <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    One thing I mentioned at the beginning of 2015 was &ldquo;we may also see some very niche use cases for all flash arrays and everything in between won't go away and there will be a use case somewhere.&rdquo; I think this area has moved on quite a lot in 2015, mostly around the All Flash vendors gaining some good traction and the price point of SSD over spinning disks greatly being reduced along with capacity enhancements also assisting in that area of adoption. Is it the end of spinning disk? No that stuff is not going away just yet&hellip; think tape that hasn&rsquo;t and nor will spinning disk there is always a use case. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>        &ldquo;Converged Infrastructure Vs Hyper-Converged Infrastructure&rdquo; <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    I believe this area hasn&rsquo;t moved as quickly as expected I think the larger storage vendors have realised that &ldquo;simplicity&rdquo; is something that customers want to see and have within their infrastructure and this bolted onto any infrastructure be it storage, compute and networking. HCI isn&rsquo;t going away and there is still very much a market for this type of infrastructure, from my experience though I have been involved in very few HCI projects where as there is still a strong presence of converged infrastructure, I would probably change the vs to or though there is a use case for both as I said. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    <strong>TechOntap Podcast </strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    To top of this great year, I was also invited to guest speak on the NetApp Tech Ontap podcast &ndash; Episode 14 &ldquo;Protecting Your Data with SnapMirror to Everything&rdquo; - <a style="" href="https://soundcloud.com/techontap_podcast/episode-14-protecting-your-data-with-snapmirror-to-everything">https://soundcloud.com/techontap_podcast/episode-14-protecting-your-data-with-snapmirror-to-everything</a> It was a great privilege to be asked onto the podcast, I have listened to this podcast since day one and been very much advocating the podcast alongside everything else that NetApp have been doing over the years. Hopefully I didn&rsquo;t do a bad job and they will have me back on to discuss some more data protection or integrations with Veeam soon. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>            </div></div><div class='blog-social'><div class='blog-social-item'><a class='twitter-share-button' href='http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvzilla.co.uk%2F1%2Fpost%2F2016%2F01%2F2015-a-year-in-review.html' data-count='horizontal'></a></div><div class='blog-social-item blog-fb-like'><fb:like href='http://vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2016/01/2015-a-year-in-review.html' show_faces='false' layout='button_count' width='90'></fb:like></div><div style='clear:both'></div></div>

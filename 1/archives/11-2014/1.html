<p class='blog-comments'><a href='/1/post/2014/11/back-to-the-land-of-the-living-update-from-insight-2014.html#comments' class='blog-link'>8 Comments</a></p></div><div class='blog-separator'> &nbsp; </div><div class='blog-content'><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Over the last month i have been pretty busy attending the NetApp insight conferences in both Las Vegas and in Berlin as well as doing my normal day job. <br /><span><br /><span><span><span>First up was Las Vegas for my first visit and my first US version of the event. You can see some of the tourist things i did whilst out there. I found the city to be of huge scale, and its a city where you dont want to be extending your stay past 4-5 days, it's a city that takes a lot.... quite literally. <br /><span><br /><span>We then had a couple of weeks break then it was time to venture down to Germany for the EMEA event that was to be held at the CityCube in Berlin. Having only arrived back the day after Insight and writing this blog post its a much smaller scale on the event, simply because of the amount of people that attend the US conference against the EMEA one. I have been to Berlin a few times for work engagements but never for a conference or for a personal holiday. In my opinion the conference was great but i found the distance between hotels, the conference centre and events was too far and something that we didnt have in previous events. However we are back to Berlin next year, my fellow NetApp A Team members should be joining us next year. <br /><span><br /><span>In the last two weeks we have heard a number of announcments and i wanted to share some of them announments, updates and aquisitions with you. <span><span></span></span> <br /><span><br /></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">New Releases <br /></h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">  You have probably seen the announcements by now but I wanted to put something down and forward out the key things that i picked up and heard whilst at the events. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Firstly we have some big releases that have happened this week, i have also included the release notes where possible for the new releases. <br /><span></span><br /><span></span>These include: <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    OnCommand Workflow Automation 3.0 RC1 -&nbsp; https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_get_file/ECMP1644815<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  OnCommand System Manager 8.3 (back to onbox management software)<br /><span>Extract below taken from the Clustered Data Ontap 8.3 release notes - https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_get_file/ECMP1636023<br /><span></span></span><br /><span></span>Unsupported features for OnCommand SystemManager 8.3<br /><span></span>Support for some System Manager functionality is discontinued in this release.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>Installation changes<br /><span></span>Starting with Data ONTAP 8.3, System Manager is no longer available as a stand-alone applicationand cannot be used to manage multiple storage systems running different versions of Data ONTAP.You can use System Manager 8.3 to manage only a Data ONTAP 8.3 cluster.You do not have to install System Manager 8.3 because it is included with Data ONTAP as a webservice, enabled by default, and accessible by using a browser.<br /><span><br /><span></span></span>Log file changes<br /><span></span>You do not have to create a support bundle and send it to technical support to analyze and resolveissues with System Manager. The System Manager log files are located in the mlog directory alongwith the Data ONTAP log files and are included as part of the AutoSupport messages that aretriggered on a daily basis.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>Password caching<br /><span></span>You cannot enable password caching to save your storage system credentials<span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <br /><span></span>OnCommand Unified Manager 6.2 RC1 - https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_get_file/ECMP1653274<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  OnCommand Performance Manager 1.1 RC1 - https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_get_file/ECMP1552963<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span>We of course saw the new release of 8.3RC1, a long awaited release from many of us, it now has true feature parity with 7mode and there are not many circumstances where 7mode will need to be used over Clustered Ontap with this latest release. In the next session i will list some of the new features that have come with the release of 8.3. <br /></span><br /><span style=""></span>  </div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">New Features<br /></h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">As i said above this release has taken a while to reach us but the features it brings are priceless. With a code name of "Full Steam" the release of 8.3 had to bring everything to the forefront for clustered ontap after the last three years we have progressively seen the numbers switch between 7mode and clustered ontap, and with clustered ontap 8.3 the use case has to be the majority. <br /><span><br /><span>In this section i am going to list a few of the new features and give a brief description on each one. <br /><span><br /><span>Automated Workload Analyser </span></span></span></span>- The AWA feature analyzes the read-write workload mix and the percentage  of reads and writes that are cacheable for an aggregate. This shows  whether an HDD-only aggregate is a good candidate to be converted to a Flash Pool aggregate, and what an optimal cache size would be for your workload.<br /><span><br /><span>Onbox System Manager</span></span> - with the release of 8.3 we have moved back to an onbox function, this will avoid lots of instances of management software spread around the environment and gives you that single access pane, as soon as i get the chance i intend to blog about this new onbox management piece. <br /><span><br /><span>IP Spaces - a very big feature release for multi tenacy environments is the addition of IP spaces, it allows for overlapping subnets and addresses. One IP space may contain multiple SVMs but to remove complication for other non multi tentant environments, there will be a default IP Space. <br /><span><br /><span>Root-Data HDD Partitioning for Entry Platforms - Internal enclosure HDDs are shared for root and data aggregates per node this will improve the storage efficency dramatically compared to the original dedicated root aggregate configurations. This will be the default configuration for FAS25** and FAS22** systems shipped with 8.3. <br /><span><br /><span></span></span>SSD Partitioning for Flash Pool Cache - This will allow for better SSD capacity effciencty by sharing SSDs across multiple flash pool aggregates, this will be achieved by reducing parity and spare SSD cost with up to 4 Flash Pool Aggregates. <br /><span><br /><span></span></span>Metrocluster - Over in Berlin this week this was the biggest feature release to date for clustered ontap, from a european point of view there is a strong use case for Metrocluster or multiple campas requirements for the same level of data and protection, hence why Metrocluster is big in EMEA. <br /><span><br /><span>Highlights for the metrocluster release: <br /><span><span>-2 node cluster at each site <br /><span>-Clients served from all 4 nodes in normal operation. All Nodes are ACTIVE! <br /><span>-</span></span></span></span></span></span>Local HA feature handles all local failures <br /><span>-Inter-site links consolidation to reduce telecom cost<br /><span>-Nondisruptive operation support. <br /><span><br /><span></span></span></span></span>We have also seen the release of 7MTT 2.0 which adds support for: <br /><span>-</span>8.3 destinations <br /><span>-Transitioning into a clustered ontap 8.3 Metrocluster<br /><span>-SAN transition to data ontap 8.3 </span></span></span></span></span><br /><span></span></span><!--[if gte mso 9]>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-GB   X-NONE   X-NONE                                             MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   <![endif]--></div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">The Hybrid Cloud Model<br /></h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Along with the great features we have also heard a lot about "Cloud" and in particular the "Hybrid Cloud" <br /><span><br /></span>The Hybrid Cloud is a cloud computing environment in  which an organization provides and manages some resources in-house and  has others provided externally.<br /><span><br /><span><span>With that in mind NetApp have released two products this last month, <span><br /><span><br /><span>NetApp Private Storage<br /><span>To summarise NetApp Private Storage (NPS) allows you to place your own physical equipment into a datacentre which holds the pop for either Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, this will allow you to use your NetApp Storage systems with the AWS or Azure compute and network resource. <br /><span><br /><span>CloudOntap <br /><span></span></span></span></span>CloudOntap is a virtual machine instance that can be purchased currently on Amazon Web Services, but hopefully this will change in the forseeable future and be made available on other platforms. In brief cloudontap has many use cases, it could be from a simple backup stance where you currently have a FAS system on your premises, you could replicate from on prem to the cloud ontap instance for a backup offsite. you may also use cloud ontap for burstable workloads a seasonal e retailer would be an ideal candidate here, where over for example the Christmas period where workloads are increased, more compute can be used in the Hybrid cloud. <br /><span><br /><span>i intend to deep dive a little further into both of these areas and intend then to write about their progression and use cases over the next few months. </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class='blog-social'><div class='blog-social-item'><a class='twitter-share-button' href='http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvzilla.co.uk%2F1%2Fpost%2F2014%2F11%2Fback-to-the-land-of-the-living-update-from-insight-2014.html' data-count='horizontal'></a></div><div class='blog-social-item blog-fb-like'><fb:like href='http://vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2014/11/back-to-the-land-of-the-living-update-from-insight-2014.html' show_faces='false' layout='button_count' width='90'></fb:like></div><div style='clear:both'></div></div>

Plus two exam slots. This meant that 22 sessions were not going to make the cut. </span></span><span>Here is how the week looks for me over in Vegas, a pretty busy schedule for the 4 day event.<br /><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="/uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/8203669_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:732px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">Monday<span></span><br /></h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">  MS-2-1804-TT - Sizing Microsoft Applications Using SPM and E-Series Sizing Tools<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  Niyaz Mohamed<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  This session is aimed at covering the sizing steps and approaches that should be used for sizing Microsoft Exchange, SQL Servers and SharePoint using System Performance Modeler. Exchange, SQL and SharePoint sizing methodologies have been re-architected and this session will give Netapp field and partners the information on how to accurately size and use the input methodology correctly. The new SQL and SharePoint sizer workflow will be covered in detail. This session also covers the Excel sheet methodology for feeding the data to SPM. The E-Series sizer tool will cover how to size for a specific application based on the network latency and throughput requirements. The session will also include examples for each application and what options need to be selected in SPM to achieve the optimized output.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    TR-2-1763-TT - An Introduction to Performance Sizing with System Performance Modeler (SPM)<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  Gregory Ferguson<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  Accurately sizing a configuration is a critical presales activity. Undersizing can lead to unhappy customers and performance escalations while oversizing can lead to uncompetitive bids. NetApp&rsquo;s SPM tool, which has had some significant enhancements in the last year, enables SEs to perform an accurate performance sizing and derive an optimal NetApp configuration proposal. This session is for both the new SE as well as the SE who wants an update on how to best utilize the newest version of SPM.&nbsp; The session will walk through SPM's process flow and provide an understanding of how to most effectively use the tool. &nbsp;We will identify and explain key input fields and how to gather the data needed for those fields.&nbsp; We will also highlight the changes to the SPM UI since 1.4.x and include a preview of how the tool will continue to evolve to enable SEs to more easily produce accurate sizings for all types of opportunities.&nbsp; The presentation will contain a number of screenshots and a list of additional resources to help with the practical application of the topics covered.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  CL-3-2140-TT - How to Deploy NetApp Private Storage (TT)<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  Mark Beaupre<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  NetApp Private Storage (NPS) combines the elasticity and savings of industry leading public clouds with security, availability, and control of private storage.

One of the problems is that there are at least three different types of administrator or architect involved &ndash; server/VMware, networking, and storage &ndash; often from different groups within IT. Being able to articulate the requirements and configuration details for all three parts and why they matter goes a long way to building the credibility to smooth the relationships and get the configuration you need so it all works. When explaining it helps to be able to enumerate the dependencies, how they apply to your environment, and how to satisfy them. This session goes through the concepts and decision criteria for points of configuration from ESXi and server network interfaces, through the switches to the storage systems. Configurations for reliability, high-availability, performance, and better utilization of your resources will be shown. We will explain why some sources of practices conflict, what changed and why, and under what circumstances the other practice might be correct.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  VI-3-2236 - NetApp Best Practices for vSphere Part 3b: Avoiding the Seven Deadly Sins of VMware Storage Networking, Part 2, Advanced<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  Pete Learmonth<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  In part 1, we covered the basics &ndash; enough to get most environments going.

For those that have attended Insight in either the US or EMEA or even APAC when this was running know how much it takes its strain on your bodies.... albeit through walking, learning, talking and the occasional networking..... <br /> <br /> I flew in McCarran International Airport on Friday 24th October, after 10 hours on a flight from London Heathrow in my head it was 03:20 but in Vegas it was around 8pm..... The first steps into any American airport so it would seem (I have been to two now) is the security is extremely high as expected, you then head to passport control.... where i think the majority of the plane myself included was actually told to put our phones away by a policeman or he would take it off and throw it in the bin! his words exactly. Obviously all the US residents were hurried through leaving 95% of us queuing to meet 2 passport control attendees! <br /> <br /> Once through it was time to get a taxi to the hotel, and this is where the people watching began... in the taxi rank there were so many different types of people, some young groups on some sort of stag do/hen do maybe, some people around thirties to fifties on vacation or out for business and then you had some real oldies but the spread of different outfits and apparel was tremendous. <br /> <br /> I get in my first Vegas cab and head over to the hotel... and pretty much straight away the size, lights and scale of the buildings in Las Vegas hits you like nowhere i have ever been on this planet! Everything was massive we drove down the strip to get to the hotel i was staying so i was able to see Caeser's Palace, The Bellagio, Paris, Planet Hollywood and New York New York. I was staying at the MGM grand in itself not a small sized venue... in comparison to back home my local shopping centre (Mall) is smaller than the MGM. <br /> <br /> When i departed the taxi and entered the hotel lobby i was greeted by a hotel lobby the size of a football pitch it was incredibly big! At this point i am feeling tired given the fact i have just travelled over 10 hours on a plane, slept very little and my time zones were all over. but then on the other hand i didn&rsquo;t want to miss an opportunity of being in Las Vegas. After getting checked in and making my way up to the hotel i dropped off my bag had a wash and headed back down to find some food.... the first night i didn&rsquo;t venture far or wide within the MGM i found Wolfgang Pucks and that&rsquo;s it, had some dinner and got to bed.... <br /> <br /> Those that have suffered from jet lag know that it strikes at normally the early hours of the morning when travelling in the US from the UK, it was no different on this trip day 2 i was awake at 430 and couldn&rsquo;t get back to sleep at all! So i headed down to see what was happening, expecting the hotel to be quiet and parts shut off etc. but that wasn&rsquo;t the case... this should be named the "city that doesn&rsquo;t sleep" because it really doesn&rsquo;t. <br /> <br /> having wandered down i noticed a Starbucks open and serving coffee... for those that know me i am addicted to coffee and Starbucks is my favourite, I grabbed a coffee and wandered around looking at the shiny lights trying not to be lured in to gamble any of my money... i believe that lasted me all of 20 mins of walking around the casino floor. Roulette was my choice game for the week and i would only use the left side of the board, none of this wasting time and money on the numbers, clearly i have no idea what i am doing but i quickly turned $10 into $20 and then that into $50 and this was where my gambling for that day and the week went completely south!<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  </div>  <div><div style="height:20px;overflow:hidden"></div> <div id='372287002995290198-slideshow'></div> <script type='text/javascript'> (function(jQuery) { function init() { wSlideshow.render({elementID:"372287002995290198",nav:"thumbnails",navLocation:"bottom",captionLocation:"bottom",transition:"fade",autoplay:"0",speed:"5",aspectRatio:"auto",showControls:"true",randomStart:"false",images:[{"url":"3\/2\/3\/9\/3239227\/3130033.jpg","width":187,"height":250,"fullHeight":800,"fullWidth":600},{"url":"3\/2\/3\/9\/3239227\/7262281.jpg","width":187,"height":250,"fullHeight":800,"fullWidth":600},{"url":"3\/2\/3\/9\/3239227\/1044333.jpg","width":187,"height":250,"fullHeight":800,"fullWidth":600}]}) } jQuery ? jQuery(init) : document.observe('dom:loaded', init) })(window._W && _W.jQuery) </script>  <div style="height:20px;overflow:hidden"></div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">  I ventured away from the Roulette tables and machines and played on some other spinning wheel game... and before i knew it the $50 was nothing!!!! <br> second on my list of things to do was to try one of the buffets so i did and i hit the MGM buffet as it was on my doorstep and i knew no different at this point in time. managed to combine breakfast and lunch into one sitting and being suitably full i went back to the room to rest. <br> <br> I did venture out and walked up and down the strip, venturing through the casino floors of all the famous hotels. but no more gambling took place that day. <br> <br> On the Sunday was when most of my fellow NetApp A Team arrived in Vegas, so a lot of us met up and headed out to frankies tiki bar a recommendation from @JK47theweapon - it was a cool bar, however no beer was disappointing but pretty cool but strong drinks nonetheless. (http://www.frankiestikiroom.com) <br> <br> Time seems to disappear pretty quickly in Vegas and before i knew it, it was Monday morning and the start of Insight. I am planning on putting other posts up regarding the technical stuff that was announced, the sessions i attended and all the other cool conversations i had with people. <br> <br> All i will say is this event gives such a great opportunity to meet the people that you hear so much from over social media, it allows you to put faces to the names or twitter handles in my case. <br> <br> Clearly through the week of insight it was a lot to do with networking, meeting new people and catching up with people that i haven't seen for a while. This involved quite a lot of drinking and eating. Most of which really was in the MGM grand, we ventured out a couple of times but mostly we would stay in and find one of the many restaurants to eat, or one of the many bars. <br> <br> One of the nights we did get to go to Downtown Vegas, a very different place to the strip. there were street shows happening and with it being Halloween week there were some interesting shows at that being performed. We wandered up and down the road, the impressive overhead canopy that stretches the full length of the road and is lit up with colourful illuminations is something i would recommend seeing, obviously there were casino's but not like the strip these looked a little more seedy and how i always imagined Vegas to be and i guess it was years gone by before the rich people built the huge new strip where i was staying. <br> <br> We got on a blackjack table and lost a bit of money and then got on a Roulette table where again we lost a little more money before heading back to the MGM. <br> <br> Thursday rolled round quite quick and the end of the conference was close, the majority of the guys i know were all heading off either early afternoon or early evening, i knew i was there for another night i didn&rsquo;t fly till Friday 930pm and by this time it is right what people say. You have had enough of Vegas after 4 days! I was ready to leave. i missed my wife and baby boy a lot! <br> <br> But there was nothing i could do about it, and as the Insight floor closed and people dispersed off, i hooked up with some friends that were over from the UK on holiday, one of the couples in the group had actually got engaged on their trip to the grand canyon. I met them in the Caeser's Palace front bar, we grabbed some food and drink and had a cracking night in Vegas.... it was the last night in Vegas, i got to see the Bellagio fountains something that i missed earlier in the week because of timings. We went to an amazing club and i am trying to find the name of the place but cannot remember... but it being the last night i managed to stay up all night not going to bed till the late hours when i need to check out at 11am! not the smartest move before heading home. <br> <br> The final day for me was very long! first of all i had to drag myself up and out of my room after no more than two hours sleep! check out and head to my friends hotel where they said i could leave my stuff till my evening flight. One of my friends the day before had bought a boxing glove from a sports memorabilia shop, because on the Friday Mike Tyson was visiting and if you bought something you were able to take it back for him to sign. So i went with both friends to get that done. i didn&rsquo;t go in as it was only one person allowed to accompany him but that was fine as i had already gate-crashed his holiday. Back to the pool after that and then it was time to leave i think i was at the airport 3 hours early.... i really wanted to sleep and go home. as soon as i sat down on that plane i was flat out and i am not normally one for sleeping on a plane. <br> <br> All in all Vegas as a city was not what i expected, i expected it to be a lot like what i saw and experienced in Downtown, i think maybe if you were going there for a holiday things would be different as well. I also found things to be really expensive, i know this is the case in large cities such as London and new York but the prices seemed extra expensive here. <br> <br> When i got back i was asked if i would go back? Well yeah... i will have to next year for NetApp Insight 2015 which is at Mandalay Bay but would i go back for a holiday or stag do, yeah i think i would like to experience that as well. but there is a long list of places i want to visit and Vegas is now ticked off so it&rsquo;s now on to the next ones. <br> <br> I am off to Berlin, Germany next this is for the EMEA leg of the NetApp Insight tour, i am hoping to pick up the sessions that i didn&rsquo;t make in the US, i am also hoping to meet and network with my fellow peers that i have either only spoken to over social networks or them guys that i haven&rsquo;t seen since last year in Dublin. <br><span><br><span>I also have some more pictures to post when i get the c</span></span><br> <br> Catch you soon. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  </div></div><div class='blog-social'><div class='blog-social-item'><a class='twitter-share-button' href='http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvzilla.co.uk%2F1%2Fpost%2F2014%2F11%2Fan-englishman-in-las-vegas.html' data-count='horizontal'></a></div><div class='blog-social-item blog-fb-like'><fb:like href='http://vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2014/11/an-englishman-in-las-vegas.html' show_faces='false' layout='button_count' width='90'></fb:like></div><div style='clear:both'></div></div>

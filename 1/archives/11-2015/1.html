It will be my first time at an Insight event where I have been a &ldquo;booth babe&rdquo; <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    I am really looking forward to the event and I do have some free time to attend some sessions whilst there, the schedule I have selected is outlined below, my main aim is to gather any revision material I can around the new exam sets that NetApp have recently released. Another reason for me really looking forward to attending is the Alliance partnership between NetApp &amp; Veeam is in a great place at the moment with some really great features that were released by Veeam last November in version 8 and coming in version 9 we have more dedicated features released for NetApp. It&rsquo;s going to be great catching up with my peers and giving them the deep dive into what we do and how we can help&hellip;.&nbsp; <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">My Schedule<br /></h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      Previous years I have posted a mix of different sessions that I have scheduled to attend whilst at the conference. Given my role change since last year my focus is more around the Data Protection piece, so really interested in what is coming from NetApp around this area such as SnapCenter, AltaVault and E-Series. After hearing some of the announcements about &ldquo;SnapMirror to Everything&rdquo; I am also very keen to hear more about how this can help the Alliance between Veeam and NetApp further. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    You will also see a lot of Exam preparation sessions for each of the new exam sets that have been introduced earlier in the year. These are something I would like to see and hear so that when the time comes I will have some preparation in place for my revision. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="../../../uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/8396003_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:569px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">Things to see in Berlin.... <br /></h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      <strong>Olympic Stadium </strong>&ndash; for those that attended Insight in Berlin last year the NetApp EMEA event was held here and it was a very impressive venue, the event is not going to be held there this year but if you do have some free time be sure to visit. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="../../../uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/910875_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:1100px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      <strong>Classic Remise Berlin</strong> - If you love cars then this is well worth the visit, it&rsquo;s free and there are a lot of old rare and expensive cars here.

To set the scene here is a brief overview of the product portfolio as it was purchased by NetApp in November 2014 by a good friend of mine @JK47theweapon&nbsp; -&nbsp; <a style="" href="http://www.jk-47.com/2015/05/netapp-altavault-speeding-up-cutting-costs-and-cloudify-your-backups/">http://www.jk-47.com/2015/05/netapp-altavault-speeding-up-cutting-costs-and-cloudify-your-backups/</a> <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    In the same way I have touched on the DAS and SAN approach with the for mentioned &ldquo;Appliances&rdquo; I wanted to put a case over as to why AltaVault is a great fit for your backup infrastructure with Veeam. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">                      <strong style="" "mso-bidi-font-weight:="" normal"="">What is AltaVault </strong><br /><span style=""></span>      </h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      Well AltaVault is a &ldquo;Cloud Integrated Storage&rdquo; device. Some physical disk in your location but it&rsquo;s then able to upload data of a specific criteria up to many different &ldquo;Cloud&rdquo; environments. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    The local physical disk is presented out over NAS protocols so that can be either SMB or NFS this is presented to your backup media server and this is where the backups are pointed to within the job. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Storage efficiencies are a big factor when it comes to the modern data center. The real estate cost for shelves and shelves of storage is expensive in any case, So when sizing any backup solutions and in an ideal situation you are only keeping the changes since the last incremental meaning new data or even if we are wanting to keep more and more full backups we can do in leveraging global storage efficiencies. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    The AltaVault range uses inline deduplication and compression, this is on a global front as well not on a per volume level as per the NetApp FAS or on a per backup job from Veeam. That&rsquo;s an important point., Another important thing to mention is the ability to encrypt your data at rest and in flight. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="../../../uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/6691445_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:415px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      <strong>Platforms and Sizing </strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    NetApp today have two physical AltaVault appliances and several capacity based virtual appliances. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Another point to mention here before getting into the Technical specifications is the modes in which are available on the AltaVault system. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Backup Mode &ndash; Local backup mode is used when you want to store some backup files and data locally within the customer/end user DC. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  Cold Storage Mode &ndash; Only Metadata is stored locally the rest is stored directly into a cloud provider. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Below I am only going to mention the Backup Mode because restore speeds I feel would not be acceptable given where I am positioning this as a solution. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Physical Appliances - <a style="" href="http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3687.pdf">http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3687.pdf</a> <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="../../../uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/6321976_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:699px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      Virtual Appliances - <a style="" href="http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3689.pdf">http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3689.pdf</a> <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="../../../uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/6709099_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:699px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      *The above figures were taken from NetApp.Com nothing has been tested by myself, although in the process of sourcing some equipment. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><ul><li>    Integrates with Veeam Software as an NFS or SMB share. </li><li>  Deduplicates.

I have said it many times before and will continue to say it&hellip; Cloud adoption will be off the back of Backup As A Service or Disaster Recovery As A Service in my opinion this will drive to further adoption in other areas. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="../../../uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/5510867_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:556px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">                      Things to take into consideration <br /><span style=""></span>      </h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><ul><li>                      Do not perform reverse incremental or synthetic full backups </li><li> Disable compression. Encryption and deduplication on the Veeam backup job to avoid unrequired resource usage. </li><li> Set the load control on the AltaVault Management to Control Operations.

<p class='blog-comments'><a href='../../post/2015/11/a-little-late-to-the-game-vdm30in30.html#comments' class='blog-link'>1 Comment</a></p></div><div class='blog-separator'> &nbsp; </div><div class='blog-content'><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Last year I was really intrigued in participating in the #vDM30in30 but there was very little chance of me hitting anywhere near enough posts, plus not hearing or knowing anything about it till we were pretty much already in November meant there was no chance of getting involved. <br /><span><br /><span>Firstly what is #vDM30in30? Well during the month of November on each of the 30 days a new blog post is created, there is no fix on what these should be about there can be and have been a range of personal and technical posts come out during the month. If you want to know more then <a title="" href="http://vmiss.net/writing/vdm30in30-is-coming-qa-inside/">here</a> are some questions and answers from Melissa Palmer a fellow member of the NetApp A-Team and she can write..... over 22k words last year is some effort. <br /><span><br /><span>I am already late to the game which isn't the best start for this but I am confident I can catch up.... I have a few events during the month of November which is either going to really assist on new topics to write about or it's just not going to happen. <br /><span><br /><span><span>So already the 4th of the month, I have this post plus a technical post that is also being posted today. My feelings though about producing content is that it needs to be interesting. Something that @vMiss33 managed last November every single post was well written and very informative. So with that in mind I would much rather get 20 posts out or 10 posts that help people or inform people rather than writing about something that's not. <br /><span><br /><span>From my point of view I am not much of a writer... I think I have some great ideas around blog posts but it\s generally a time thing to sit down and create that idea in writing. </span></span></span></span></span><br /><span></span></span></span></span></span></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="../../../uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/1297289_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:300px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Something else to add in this post is as well as this challenge I have also started the #BeardedHeroes challenge. To give a little background to this the #BeardedHeroes campaign was formed by The Anaphylaxis Campaign. <br /><span><br /><span>This challenge comprises of growing a beard.... not too hard for someone that is pretty lazy when it comes to facial hair tidyness. but none the less I signed up, normally this would be for the month of December, I felt that would be a very normal month for me so I decided to begin on the 25th October where I already had a good healthy showing of facial beardness. The rules do not state that I had to be clean shaven so I just started then and here we are 9 days on. <br /><span><br /><span>N<span></span>ormally around this time of year I would take part in the Movember phenomenon, however this year I decided to go for something different. </span><span>A little background onthis charity, <br /><span><br /><span></span></span>"</span></span></span></span>Anaphylaxis Campaign is the only UK wide charity to exclusively meet  the needs of the growing numbers of people at risk from severe allergic  reactions (anaphylaxis) by providing information and support relating to  foods and other triggers such as latex, drugs and insect stings."<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span> <span>Now the why this charity... just over a year ago pretty much to the day of the 25th October my son was around 6 months old and my wife and I were weaning Jack on all the different new foods in particular we took clear notice of the mid wives advice around separating the different allergens for each feed. Well came the day when we had been through the majority of the allergens we had done the Wheat, Gluten etc but we had not tried Peanut, Tree nuts or Egg. Thinking there should be no problem as we have no background in our families with allergies we proceeded with the peanut testing.... I can safely say that it was the scariest experience so far in my life! within 5 minutes Jack was swelling up and struggling to breathe what we know now as an </span>anaphylatic<span> shock. I was holding Jack for the duration trying to calm him down whilst we waited for an ambulance. It seemed like a lifetime for the ambulance to arrive but it was under 10 minutes, they issued Jack with some adrenaline and then they took him into hospital where he stayed the night. <br /><span><br /><span>A year on from that Jack has not had any other shocks, fully tested on 98% of all Tree nuts and Egg and all diary have also been fine as well as seafood. We now carry two Epi-Pens wherever we go with Jack just in case a reaction was to happen whilst out. <br /><span><br /><span></span></span>The amount of information that we simply did not know about allergies, intolerances and </span></span></span>anaphylaxis was scary, this charity amongst many other parents and sufferers across the world with their blog pages and articles on the matter was priceless to me and my wife. understanding safe food suppliers and all the rulings. <br /><span><br /><span>I wanted to do something to help not only raise money for this great charity but also raise awareness of this... anaphylaxis is a killer its not an allergy and its not an intolerance and it certainly isn't a fashion statement. I for one want to make this world the safest place for my son to grow up in, I don't want any new parents to have to experience what I did on that night. <br /><span><br /><span>I could have easily made this two posts and made my month a lot easier but maybe I will dedicate another post just to this topic later on in the month. <br /><span><br /><span>One final note on this is if you can spare any money for this charity then please donate to </span></span></span></span></span></span>                      <a style="" href="https://www.justgiving.com/Michael-Cade/">https://www.justgiving.com/Michael-Cade/</a> <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>      Hopefully you find the next 30 posts interesting and learn something from them, please comment away or reach out on twitter always happy to help or chime in on anything. <br /> </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="../../../uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/5375747_orig.jpg" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:236px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div></div><div class='blog-social'><div class='blog-social-item'><a class='twitter-share-button' href='http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvzilla.co.uk%2F1%2Fpost%2F2015%2F11%2Fa-little-late-to-the-game-vdm30in30.html' data-count='horizontal'></a></div><div class='blog-social-item blog-fb-like'><fb:like href='http://vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2015/11/a-little-late-to-the-game-vdm30in30.html' show_faces='false' layout='button_count' width='90'></fb:like></div><div style='clear:both'></div></div>

</div><div class='blog-separator'> &nbsp; </div><div class='blog-content'><h2 style="text-align:left;">Introduction<br /></h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      A few weeks back I put a post together around the Cisco UCS C class high density storage and server and how it really works as an ideal Veeam appliance in some scenarios, as part of this series I wanted to choose a SAN based appliance as well as next touching on a Cloud Integrated solution which will be coming up shortly. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span>You can find the post regarding the Cisco UCS C Class Appliance here - </span>                      <a style="" href="http://bit.ly/1jrb6fD">http://bit.ly/1jrb6fD</a> <br /><span></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Firstly, I chose for the SAN appliance post to talk about the NetApp E-Series range, the E-Series offers a high performance backup repository for us as Veeam to store out backup files.&nbsp; This coupled with the high density of storage and the performance of recovery from an enterprise level storage array provides a great story as to why the E-Series is a great fit for a SAN based Veeam repository. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">NetApp E-Series Product Description<br /></h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      NetApp have two streams or products within the E-Series portfolio that being the E-Series and the EF-Series for the purpose of this post I am going to touch only on the E-Series purely because it is quite unrealistic but not unheard of for end users to require an all flash array for backup purposes. However, the EF-Series has the same SANtricity OS as the E-Series range so all points in the post are still relevant to that. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">E2700 &amp; E5600<br /></h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      Both SAN storage arrays with connectivity options of FC, iSCSI or SAS. Both scale up from a capacity point of view by adding additional disk shelves. The options around disks from a controller and storage point of view are 2U with 12 disks or 4U with 60 disks. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    The E-Series family uses a lightweight operating system / management software called SANtricity. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><ul><li>    Dynamic Drive rebalancing</li><li>RAID Management </li><li>  Intelligent Cache Tiering </li><li>  Data Replication </li></ul><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    I have listed some key features below for the NetApp E-Series and some value add that you may not get from other SAN based backup targets. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    I have mentioned the High density storage meaning less physical estate or rack requirements for a large capacity storage solution, this also brings reduced power and cooling requirements. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Another key feature of the E-Series array is the Dynamic Disk Pools (DDP) this technical feature enables the dynamic rebalancing of drives, allowing for an easy way of growing capacity whilst also providing disk level protection if a drive was to fail. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  The final feature I am going to mention is the Disk Encryption, an enterprise feature within the storage array market and sometimes a requirement for all tiers of backup storage. The ability to encrypt at the drive level using the AES 128BIT algorithm plus simplified key management provides that level of security without an impact on performance.&nbsp; <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    There are several other features within the E-Series range but when it comes to the SAN Appliance the ones I have mentioned above are the key differentiators that I see against the competitors. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    <strong>E27** </strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    RAW capacity = 1.2PB <br /><span style=""></span>  Max Number of Drives = 192<br /><span style=""></span>    E2712 = 2U / 12 Drives <br /><span style=""></span>  E2724 = 2U / 24 Drives (SAS/SDD options only not NL-SAS) <br /><span></span>                      E2760 = 4U / 60 Drives (NL-SAS, SAS, SDD options available) <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="../../../uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/656948_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:478px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="../../../uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/4077898_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:488px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="../../../uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/1865177_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:899px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      <strong><span style="">E56** </span></strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span></span>                      RAW capacity =&nbsp;

My next post regarding the cloud integrated appliance may have a better use case as the Archive piece. It really depends on the data you are backing up and where the locality of that data needs to be as to which solution works. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">                      <font size="2"><strong style="">Off Premises Backup / Replication target </strong></font><br /><span style=""></span>      </h2>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="../../../uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/3937842_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:975px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      Another scenario where the E-Series may fit is in an already FAS for production storage scenario much the same as the first scenario but with Veeam ability to talk to the underlying NetApp FAS storage API the backup window is greatly reduced as well as the hit on the production vSphere environment. The big thing to note here is by leveraging the E-Series as the primary backup storage you are not using the same hardware, but from a support perspective you are able to speak to the same technical support for all storage related issues. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Veeam replication jobs can also be used here for fast disaster recovery SLAs without the requirement of expensive DR storage systems. A Veeam Backup Copy job can then be used for an offsite backup to another E-Series device. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">                      <strong style="">Benefits of Veeam &amp; NetApp E-Series</strong><br /><span style=""></span>      </h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      The fundamental reason that the NetApp E-Series is a great fit for a backup repository is because of the storage performance, the restore capabilities from Veeam are greatly improved when the storage system can deal with those operations in a fast and timely manner. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    The restore capabilities with the E-Series and Veeam the ability to leverage the backup data to perform verification tasks and to bring up a virtual environment for testing purposes is a huge plus for this storage system acting as a backup repository.&nbsp; <br /><span style=""></span>      </div></div><div class='blog-social'><div class='blog-social-item'><a class='twitter-share-button' href='http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvzilla.co.uk%2F1%2Fpost%2F2015%2F11%2Fappliances-appliances-everywhere-veeam-and-netapp-e-series-backup-appliance.html' data-count='horizontal'></a></div><div class='blog-social-item blog-fb-like'><fb:like href='http://vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2015/11/appliances-appliances-everywhere-veeam-and-netapp-e-series-backup-appliance.html' show_faces='false' layout='button_count' width='90'></fb:like></div><div style='clear:both'></div></div>

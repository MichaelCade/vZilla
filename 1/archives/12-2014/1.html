Jack was born in April of this year and since then it&rsquo;s been the best experience of my life so far. Having your first born really puts things into perspective, it's no longer just about yourself anymore. I for one massively underestimated having a baby was going to change my life so much, if you did read the prediction post from last year <a style="" href="../12-2013/1.html">http://www.vzilla.co.uk/1/archives/12-2013/1.html</a>&nbsp; you will see what i mean, at the time of writing my own personal goals and objectives i was completely not thinking that we had our first baby on the way and this would change the circumstances and also the focus around time and effort elsewhere. <br /> <br /> The real reason for this post is to look over the predictions i made last year but also look over the objectives i made and how i approached them.&nbsp; <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong style="">Flash</strong> <br /> The flash scene in 2014 was something that kicked on a little further in my opinion. We saw many of the new start-ups grow but we also saw most of the big storage vendors take up flash offerings, this in itself proves that flash is moving forward and a becoming of something. <br /> <br /> Personally it was only the array based Flash that i had any exposure to last year and not so much on the server side. I believe 2015 will see the two grow further and we will be seeing a lot more flash. <br /> <br /> <strong style="">Clustered OnTap </strong><br /> Are we there yet? From a feature parity point of view, yes we are. With the latest release of 8.3 back in late November we now have Metrocluster amongst other new features, but i believe it was Metrocluster that was holding back many of the EMEA customers from moving to Clustered Ontap. <br /> <br /> In my prediction at the start of 2014 i said it was a case of people not being skilled up, this has slowly changed throughout the year and our company have completed more Clustered Ontap installations that 7Mode installations but i am not sure of the figures they won&rsquo;t be far apart that&rsquo;s for sure. <br /> <br /> I am hopeful that this traction in 2015 will continue to grow and there will be no real reason to use 7mode unless there is an extreme scenario that requires to do so. <br /> <br /> <strong style="">Hybrid Cloud Adoption</strong> <br /> As i stated in my Prediction post for 2014 i mentioned that "cloud has been around for years and years&hellip; it is in fact just infrastructure located in your business premises or in a remote datacentre" <br /> <br /> The above has not changed at all its still the case but what my prediction was, was to be able to move from that on premise infrastructure to a public managed cloud and back again without the weeks or month wait. it needs to be seamless and allow for that burst workload, or DR as a Service etc. etc. <br /> <br /> Although i don&rsquo;t believe we are full there it's happening that&rsquo;s for sure, with the likes of Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, there is not a day this year when i have not seen one of those two offerings mentioned. <br /> <br /> From my point of view this is a real talking point within meetings now from a NetApp stance, with the addition of CloudOnTap on Amazon Web Services, which is an instance of the clustered ontap operating system running in the AWS environment allowing you to replicate to and from a physical NetApp storage system, the possibilities to now bridge that gap between on prem and public is there. <br /> <br /> There really is a whole blog post we can go into though around hybrid cloud and offerings that are here today. I believe 2015 is only going to extend the capabilities and what we can achieve by utilising both in house hardware and public infrastructure. <br /> <br /> On a side note to this one thing i started using this year was "onedrive/skydrive" as a cloud based backup/documents repository, i had been using DropBox for a while but purely for a P2P file share and never for backup purposes (purely because of the space provided by DropBox) whereas the Microsoft offering for no cost gives you heaps of space to store everything. <br /> <br /> <strong style="">Personal Goals and Objectives </strong><br /> As i mentioned in the opening paragraph having a baby really does change your life! And because of that it&rsquo;s my excuse for not completing the huge list of exams i set out to contend with at the beginning of the year. <br /> <br /> But let&rsquo;s talk about what i have managed, I did sit the NCIE - 504 exam in early 2014 and got a 71% mark and i believe the pass mark is actually 73% or 75%, because my NCIE - 502 expired at the end of Feb 2014 i just retook this exam getting a cool 90% to give me 2 years to complete the 504 exam which is booked for the first week in Jan 2015. <br /> <br /> I also sat the opening Cisco CCNA DC exam (640-911) this was my first Cisco exam and there being no "back" button really threw me. Although that&rsquo;s not an excuse i should know the content and i didn&rsquo;t. Another close score but not close enough. <br /> <br /> One thing i did find though was i had a lot going on this year and exams need time. The study time cannot be rushed or crammed and this is what i was doing with both of the above exams. I decided that i wouldn&rsquo;t attempt any other exams and i would work through them in 2015 in a more controlled approach, as i said there is no point in rushing them and only learning content for an exam for it to be evicted again for the next exam. <br /> <br /> Having said the above everyone that had done a VMware VCP received an expiry date for their Certification and if you took VCP5 when it first came out then you will have had until the 10th March 2015 to complete an exam again. This said there was an online VCP5-DCV Delta exam that you were able to take at home to renew your certification, so i spent a few days prepping for this exam and then booked (you then have 24 hours to complete) this was my cramming period, although open book you actually still need to know the content with 65 questions and 75 minutes to complete you had little over 1 minute for each question. I have written about the material i read and how i went about approaching the exam - <a style="" href="http://www.vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2014/12/vmware-vcp5-dcv-delta-recertification-exam.html">http://www.vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2014/12/vmware-vcp5-dcv-delta-recertification-exam.html <br /> <br /> </a>having passed the update exam for the VCP and also renewing my NCIE back in early 2014 these were the only two exams i managed to pass in 2014. Leaving the list for 2015 ever growing. <br /> <br /> Please check out my post regarding 2015 it&rsquo;s going to be a great year.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  </div></div><div class='blog-social'><div class='blog-social-item'><a class='twitter-share-button' href='http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvzilla.co.uk%2F1%2Fpost%2F2014%2F12%2F2014-another-review-post.html' data-count='horizontal'></a></div><div class='blog-social-item blog-fb-like'><fb:like href='http://vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2014/12/2014-another-review-post.html' show_faces='false' layout='button_count' width='90'></fb:like></div><div style='clear:both'></div></div>

The difference with this challenge was it was to raise money for cancer, a disease that i had been brought closer to through friends of mine being diagnosed. <br /><span><br /><span>The first thing to clear up is i am not a person that depends on alcohol to live and get through my life, just a normal english guy that likes to drink... i think thats fair to say. <br /><span><br /><span><span>Here is the DryAthlete Cancer Research Page if you would like to find out more or take part yourself. <br /><span><a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/support-us/find-an-event/charity-challenges/dryathlon">http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/support-us/find-an-event/charity-challenges/dryathlon<br /><span><br /><span></span></span></a>I am unable to find the total amount i raised for 2014 for the DryAthlon, but i have set a target of &pound;150 for this year, but there is a twist yes i will go the full distance and not drink for the 31 days of January, but i will also be running at least a mile a day throughout the month also. <br /><br />I hear you say why.... Well over the past couple of months i have found myself so busy with work and i have not been training half as much as i was so i decided i needed to shake up my routine going into the new year. A mile isnt a huge amount at all and i will be looking at the 10-12 minutes to complete the minimum distance, but in doing this it will give me so much more than just a 12 minute workout. This way of working will hopefully allow me utilise time a lot better allowing for more time in the gym or other training. <br /><br />It's a great challenge to kick off the year and shred some of the Christmas and festivities away. <br /><br />It's going to give me something away from work to challenge me. <br /><br />It's hopefully going to continue the fundraising for Cancer that&nbsp; i have very much been apart of for the last few years with either dryathlons or Movemember. <br /><br />And most of all if this allows me to plan and schedule more activities within my day its only going to be a good thing. <br /><br />If you do happen to have a spare pound then please just put it in the pot, it will keep me on the challenge that's for sure. <br />  </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><!--[if gte mso 9]>        <![endif]--></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="/uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/341594_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:250px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Here is the link to my JustGiving Page, it would be great if you could spare something to this great charity to find that breakthrough on removing this deadly disease from our world -   <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/Michael-Cade-dryathlete2015?utm_campaign=dryathlon_soloreg_ccmpe&amp;utm_source=ccmp&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;cid=2259&amp;mid=13311626">https://www.justgiving.com/Michael-Cade-dryathlete2015?utm_campaign=dryathlon_soloreg_ccmpe&amp;utm_source=ccmp&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;cid=2259&amp;mid=13311626</a><br /><span></span><br /><span>Throughout the month i will keep notes on progress, lessons learnt and hopefully some artistic photos of my travels.

This said there was an online VCP5-DCV Delta exam that you were able to take at home to renew your certification, so i spent a few days prepping for this exam and then booked (you then have 24 hours to complete) this was my cramming period, although open book you actually still need to know the content with 65 questions and 75 minutes to complete you had little over 1 minute for each question. I have written about the material i read and how i went about approaching the exam - <a href="http://www.vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2014/12/vmware-vcp5-dcv-delta-recertification-exam.html">http://www.vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2014/12/vmware-vcp5-dcv-delta-recertification-exam.html <br /> <br /> </a>having passed the update exam for the VCP and also renewing my NCIE back in early 2014 these were the only two exams i managed to pass in 2014. Leaving the list for 2015 ever growing. <br /> <br /> Please check out my post regarding 2015 it&rsquo;s going to be a great year.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <!--[if gte mso 9]>        <![endif]--></div></div><div class='blog-social'><div class='blog-social-item'><a class='twitter-share-button' href='http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvzilla.co.uk%2F1%2Fpost%2F2014%2F12%2F2014-just-another-review-post.html' data-count='horizontal'></a></div><div class='blog-social-item blog-fb-like'><fb:like href='http://vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2014/12/2014-just-another-review-post.html' show_faces='false' layout='button_count' width='90'></fb:like></div><div style='clear:both'></div></div>

<p class='blog-comments'><a href='/1/post/2014/12/vmware-vcp5-dcv-delta-recertification-exam.html#comments' class='blog-link'>5 Comments</a></p></div><div class='blog-separator'> &nbsp; </div><div class='blog-content'><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Yesterday i took the plunge and took the VCP550-DCV exam, this was the recertification exam to my already acquired VCP5-DCV with the newly added expiry date this was going to expire come March 2015. But what prompted me to take the exam this week was the offer of being able to take the exam online and not having to go into a testing centre. <br /><span><br /><span>Yes you heard correct a VMware open book exam.... So of course i thought i will have a go at that one. <br /><span><br /><span>The Delta exam consists of 65 questions with a scoring scale of 100-500, 300 is the pass mark. <span><span></span></span>You will have 75 minutes to complete the exam. If you are taking your VCP for the first time then you will be looking at 135 questions with the same score scale, and the time limit for this exam is 120 minutes. <br /><span><br /><span>Below i will share the resources i used for the renewal, the first place to start with any exam is the vendor's own exam blueprint. </span></span>from what i can see the blueprint is the same for both the recertifaction and the VCP550. <br /><span><br /><span>You will see the delta exam referred to as the VCP550D and the other referred to as the VCP550. You can only qualify for the VCP550D if you have a current valid VCP in Data Centre that is my understanding. <br /><span><br /><span>Exam Blueprint - https://mylearn.vmware.com/lcms/web/portals/certification/VCP_Blueprints/VCP-DCV-VCP550-Exam-Blueprint-v3_6.pdf <br /><span><br /><span></span></span> </span></span></span></span>The VCP550D exam will be available as the Online exam until March 10th 2015, so i would advise any existing VCP-DCV to get on and get this completed. You will find the steps required to do so here - https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=51919&amp;ui=www_cert&nbsp; <br /><span><br /><span></span></span>I would also advise that you take advantage of the free online training course VMware vSphere: What&rsquo;s New Fundamentals [V5.5] </span></span></span></span>available from here - https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrreg/courses.cfm?ui=www_edu&amp;a=one&amp;id_subject=51301<br /><span><br /><span>I work with VMware on a daily basis and have been for some years so i although i went through the blueprint from top to bottom i also marked a lot of the items off as items i already knew, in particular i compared the VCP5-DCV exam blueprint that i had completed in December 2011</span></span> with the new one listed above and these were the topics that i coudl see that were different. <br /><span><br /><span></span></span>  Identify vCenter Server and vCenter Server database requirements Deploy the vCenter Appliance<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  Upgrade a vSphere Distributed Switch<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  Upgrade from VMFS3 to VMFS5<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  Upgrade VMware Tools<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  Upgrade Virtual Machine hardware<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  Upgrade an ESXi Host using vCenter Update Manager<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  Secure vCenter Server and ESXi (Objective 1.5)<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  Configure and Administer Software Defined Storage (VSAN - Objective 3.3) Enable/Configure/Disable Host Power Management/Distributed Power Management Create/Delete vFlash Resource Pool<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  Assign vFlash resources to VMDKs<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  Install and Configure VMware Data Protection<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  Create a backup job with VMware Date Protection<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  Install, Configure and Administer vCenter Operations Manager (Objective 7.3)<br /><span><span><br /><span>I knew i had only this week to complete so didnt want to spend an entire lifetime re reading a number of VMware documents and covering topics that i already knew and that i worked with on a daily basis. <br /></span></span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <br />Some other areas that i dont use on a daily basis are as follows. <br /><span><br /><span></span></span>I went through VMware Pricing to understand the different versions as this has changed since my last exam - <a title="" href="http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/products/vsphere/VMware-vSphere-Pricing-Whitepaper.pdf?ClickID=dktomxrztrswwwmc0w2y2obxmbsbntycbybk">http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/products/vsphere/VMware-vSphere-Pricing-Whitepaper.pdf?ClickID=dktomxrztrswwwmc0w2y2obxmbsbntycbybk</a><br /><span><br /><span></span></span>I also flicked through this as this gives a good understanding of how things are installed short read - <a title="" href="http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/vcenter/VMware-vCenter-Server-5.5-Technical-Whitepaper.pdf?ClickID=ca4lski74ixqqqspwqvnvleksexef4npenea">http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/vcenter/VMware-vCenter-Server-5.5-Technical-Whitepaper.pdf?ClickID=ca4lski74ixqqqspwqvnvleksexef4npenea</a><br /><span><br /><span></span></span>  Single Sign on is also worth looking at here is the FAQ page - <a title="" href="http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=2057799">http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=2057799</a> <br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  And if you are not installing on a daily basis have a good read through this - &nbsp;<a title="" style="" href="https://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-55/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.vsphere.install.doc%2FGUID-C6F362AF-397C-4271-A9A1-4EEF1C718AA9.html&amp;resultof=%22vCenter%22%20%22vcenter%22%20%22Single%22%20%22singl%22%20%22Sign%22%20%22sign%22%20%22Deployment%22%20%22deploy%22">https://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-55/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.vsphere.install.doc%2FGUID-C6F362AF-397C-4271-A9A1-4EEF1C718AA9.html&amp;resultof=%22vCenter%22%20%22vcenter%22%20%22Single%22%20%22singl%22%20%22Sign%22%20%22sign%22%20%22Deployment%22%20%22deploy%22</a><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>And just to dive into some of the features I listed above that I didn&rsquo;t have to learn or that I don&rsquo;t use on a daily basis that have been released with version 5.5 I added some more reading to my revision. <br /><span><br /><span></span></span>  VSAN &ndash; You have the VMware documentation in the above link but save your time and read Duncan Epping&rsquo;s blog - <a title="" href="http://www.yellow-bricks.com/virtual-san/">http://www.yellow-bricks.com/virtual-san/</a> you will also find him on twitter as @DuncanYB I would also make a point of flicking through two documents from VMware - <a title="" href="http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/products/vsan/VSAN_Design_and_Sizing_Guide.pdf?ClickID=bezkyvsuzsldddyf1dmgmknvynln6zgfngne">http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/products/vsan/VSAN_Design_and_Sizing_Guide.pdf?ClickID=bezkyvsuzsldddyf1dmgmknvynln6zgfngne</a> and <a title="" href="http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/products/vsan/VMware_Virtual_SAN_Whats_New.pdf?ClickID=anzakro0zowvvvkpyv9s9atrktwt5zsptstn">http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/products/vsan/VMware_Virtual_SAN_Whats_New.pdf?ClickID=anzakro0zowvvvkpyv9s9atrktwt5zsptstn</a> <br /><span></span><br /><span></span>    vFlash Cache - <a title="" href="http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/vSphere_55_Flash_Read_Cache_Whats_New_WP.pdf?ClickID=dktomxrztrswwwmc0w2y2obxmbsbntycbybk">http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/vSphere_55_Flash_Read_Cache_Whats_New_WP.pdf?ClickID=dktomxrztrswwwmc0w2y2obxmbsbntycbybk</a> <br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  App HA - <a title="" href="http://pubs.vmware.com/appha-11/topic/com.vmware.ICbase/PDF/vsphere-app-ha-users-guide-11.pdf">http://pubs.vmware.com/appha-11/topic/com.vmware.ICbase/PDF/vsphere-app-ha-users-guide-11.pdf</a> <br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  vSphere Data Protection - <a title="" href="http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/vsphere/VMware-vSphere-Data-Protection-Overview.pdf">http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/vsphere/VMware-vSphere-Data-Protection-Overview.pdf</a> <br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  vRealize Operations &ndash; this is a huge topic in this exam&hellip; so I would suggest reading quite a bit unless you use it on a daily basis, this was not something I was really familiar with but had configured a lot prior to the exam in my home lab as well as reading a lot of white papers and data sheets&hellip;. <a title="" href="http://www.vmware.com/uk/products/vrealize-operations-insight/resources.html">http://www.vmware.com/uk/products/vrealize-operations-insight/resources.html</a> <br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  I think if possible I would also look at the VMware VCA exams these are an &ldquo;associate&rdquo; level exams but they cover a lot of the content above but I believe (they were when I took them) they can be taken at home&hellip;   <br /><span></span><br /><span></span>Finally I would suggest taking some of the practice tests on the VMware MYLearn page.   <br /><span><br /><span><span>I managed a 487 pass mark out of 500 which i was really quite chuffed with... i am such a nervous exam taker and really despise going to the test center so having this exam available online at home was amazing. <br /><span><br /><span>Feel free to post your comments and your own scores, i would be interested to hear your feedback on the exam also. <br /></span></span></span></span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span><!--[if gte mso 9]>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-GB   X-NONE   X-NONE                                             MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   <![endif]--></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="/uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/1180920_orig.jpg" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:931px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="/uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/958871_orig.jpg" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:1050px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div></div><div class='blog-social'><div class='blog-social-item'><a class='twitter-share-button' href='http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvzilla.co.uk%2F1%2Fpost%2F2014%2F12%2Fvmware-vcp5-dcv-delta-recertification-exam.html' data-count='horizontal'></a></div><div class='blog-social-item blog-fb-like'><fb:like href='http://vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2014/12/vmware-vcp5-dcv-delta-recertification-exam.html' show_faces='false' layout='button_count' width='90'></fb:like></div><div style='clear:both'></div></div>

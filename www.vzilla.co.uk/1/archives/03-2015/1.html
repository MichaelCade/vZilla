<p class='blog-comments'><a href='/1/post/2015/03/90-day-challenge-completed-2015.html#comments' class='blog-link'>3 Comments</a></p></div><div class='blog-separator'> &nbsp; </div><div class='blog-content'><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The fact that i am writing this means i have completed the 90 day challenge, at the start of 2015 i decided to kick the year off with a challenge for January, this also included the infamous Dry January where no booze is drank... that was the easy bit, i also challenged myself to complete at least 1 mile of running every day for the full 31 days. I completed this and i have a post regarding this challenge here - http://vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2015/01/january-2015-challenge-completed.html <br /><span><br /><span>At the end of that first month i decided that i would carry this on and challenge myself for February as well as March although i kept that quiet until i completed the second month. and here we have it 90 days of running every single day. (here is the Feb completed post - http://vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2015/03/february-2015-challenge-completed.html)<br /><span><br /><span>The challenge for March was to complete at least 2 miles a day for the entire 31 days of the month. </span></span></span></span>#2MileADayMarch15 was born and used throughout the month although not as much as during the other months as i was starting to feel i was annoying a lot of people on either Twitter or Facebook branding these runs on a daily basis. <br /><span><br /><span><span>Well i just about managed the above and below you will find the complete 90 day challenge pace and distance graph of what i achieved over the past 3 months. <br /><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="/uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/6812594_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:1015px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Also below this you will see the month calendar outlining every single one of the runs i completed in March. I have to admit that during this month was the closest i became to quitting, mostly down to work and family commitments but as well as running this far on a daily basis and your body not really getting the recovery time required my body was struggling. <span><span></span></span> <span><span></span></span></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="/uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/2077854_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:923px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Challenge - Complete at least 2 miles a day in March, 31 days and a minimum target of 62 miles. <br /><span><br /><span>Challenge Completed - 31/03/2015 <br /><span><br /><span>90 Days / 90 Workouts <br /><span>172.9 Miles Covered <span><br /><span>31.63 hours spent training <br /><span><br /><span>As i mentioned in the February completed post a lot of my inspiration throughout came from the Tom Mendoza video about setting goals etc, i have always been very good from a work perspective around setting training goals, exam etc etc but personally i have never completed or attempted anything like this before. I encourage everyone to watch that video from Tom it truly gives you some inspiration. <br /><span><br /><span>The experience of the 90 day challenge has been great, in myself i feel a lot healthier and fitter than before. i honestly never thought past the challenge in hand but truthfully i didn't think i would complete the January challenge. </span>I feel proud of myself for pushing through and making this life changing routine. for 25-30 minutes a day i have left the house in all sorts of weather and at all sorts of time but that 25 minutes has really helped so much i believe and something i will make sure i include in my life moving forward. <br /><span><br /><span>Here are the 3 months broken down into the weeks totals</span></span><br /><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>  <div><div style="height:20px;overflow:hidden"></div> <div id='265126504381676489-slideshow'></div> <script type='text/javascript'> (function(jQuery) { function init() { wSlideshow.render({elementID:"265126504381676489",nav:"thumbnails",navLocation:"bottom",captionLocation:"bottom",transition:"fade",autoplay:"0",speed:"5",aspectRatio:"auto",showControls:"true",randomStart:"false",images:[{"url":"3\/2\/3\/9\/3239227\/1791622.png","width":333,"height":243,"fullHeight":693,"fullWidth":947},{"url":"3\/2\/3\/9\/3239227\/3898560.png","width":333,"height":209,"fullHeight":594,"fullWidth":942},{"url":"3\/2\/3\/9\/3239227\/4880720.png","width":333,"height":246,"fullHeight":682,"fullWidth":923}]}) } jQuery ? jQuery(init) : document.observe('dom:loaded', init) })(window._W && _W.jQuery) </script>  <div style="height:20px;overflow:hidden"></div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">One thing i wasn't sure about sharing was the weight loss that wasn't really even a driver for the challenges but over the last few months i have seen a great weight loss, I have not particularly till the middle of March actually done anything about my eating habits, so i was amazed when i was weighing myself and seeing some great reductions. <span><span></span></span></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="/uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/9866501_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:778px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">So what does that mean i am going to attempt next, as in the UK we are moving into Spring and Summer is just around the corner, i plan to give my knees a slight rest, i will however be looking to complete the longest run i have ever completed a good week into April just to see really how far can i go when 90 days ago i was struggling with a mile. <br /><span><br /><span>April will also see a lot of road biking, i believe my personal challenge in April will consist of traveling 200 miles during the month of April. I think my body just needs a little bit of rest away from the running, although if there is one thing i would say from this experience is to just try it... move your body for X amount of time a day for a month. You will be amazed by the progress you make and how better you feel from it. <br /><span><br /><span><br /><span>If you have any questions regarding the running or about anything in the series of this 90 day challenge then please ask away. <br /></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class='blog-social'><div class='blog-social-item'><a class='twitter-share-button' href='http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvzilla.co.uk%2F1%2Fpost%2F2015%2F03%2F90-day-challenge-completed-2015.html' data-count='horizontal'></a></div><div class='blog-social-item blog-fb-like'><fb:like href='http://vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2015/03/90-day-challenge-completed-2015.html' show_faces='false' layout='button_count' width='90'></fb:like></div><div style='clear:both'></div></div>

<p class='blog-comments'><a href='../../post/2015/03/2015-the-year-of-the.html#comments' class='blog-link'>10 Comments</a></p></div><div class='blog-separator'> &nbsp; </div><div class='blog-content'><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I wanted to put a post out there outlining where i think things will head this new year.... based purely around the storage, virtualisation, converged and data centre technologies the arena that i work in. <br /><span><br /><span><span>Along with these predictions i also want to outline my goals and objectives around blogging content, exams and other such like topics. <br /><span><br /><span><span><span>Last year my contenders for the big things to embrace the market were Flash, Clustered Ontap and Hybrid Cloud. This year here are my thoughts on 2015.... <br /><span><br /><span><strong>The continuance growth of adoption to Hybrid Cloud </strong><br /><span>The backend of 2014 saw a big jump around Hybrid Cloud offerings, something that was a buzz word at the start of the year and before is now actually a reality, sorry i should say there has been a private and public cloud offering for a few years now but the limitation was the being able to move in and out in a timley fashion. </span>Something that has been addressed by many in the backend of 2014 with the release of certain products. To compliment these products though there had to be a framework for an IT department to utilise i believe we have seen a growth around these offerings with the like of Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google and there are a lot more to mention.... <br /><span></span><br /><span></span>"<strong>Flexibility</strong> will be the biggest issue facing storage in the coming year" was said by Sean Horne CTO of EMC, and quite frankly this is true in my opinion. being able to move my data from my own data center to a cloud provider and back again is the key to this being a viable solution. Sean also went on to say about the Security &amp; Compliance dicating the decisions for companies moving to a hybrid cloud model. <br /><span><br /><span>From my point of view i believe this model or movement will continue to grow in 2015 and i for one am excited to see this evolve and be apart of this, my key focus being around NetApp and VMware both of which are really involved with this movement. Something i really want to touch on it's own post later on in the month. </span></span><br /><span><br /><span>I believe the biggest uptake to a Hybrid Cloud model would be around Disaster Recovery and Archival i then think we will see the burst workload followed by more in house applications being allowed to move freely between sites. </span></span><br /><span><br /><span></span></span><strong>Software Defined ???<br /></strong><span>We have also seen a huge </span>uptake on the "Storage Defined...." offerings. This is only going to continue to grow... what parts this is what i think. <br /><span><br /></span>People that have been in this game for a years will know that Software Defined... is the new term for Virtualisation. <br /><span><br /><span>What is Software Defined.... ? </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>1. Decoupling and abstracting controle and policy from the physical stuff that does work. <br /><span>2. Where the physical stuff that does the work can be software on commodity hardare. <br /><span>3. Programmable infrastructure APIs : Automate Everything. </span></span></span></span><br /><span><br /><span></span></span>Why Software Defined.... ? <br /><span><br /><span></span></span>1. Reduce infrastructure "fragility" by abstraction and reducing operational complexity<br /><span>2. Increase Agility. <br /><span>3. Open up new architectural options. <br /><span><br /><span></span></span></span></span>Software Defined Everything - which basically means the virtualising of everything in the datacentre and beyond, compute, storage and networks. <br /><span><br /><span>This is clearly the latest buzz word in the IT industry however things are progressing and some are just maturing certain vendors have been doing Software Defined Storage for years. However i believe 2015 will see a big increase in Software Defined Networking</span></span>, not being much of a Network Guy i will be trying to attend some more in depth training around certain SDN offerings. <br /><span><br /><span></span></span><strong>Flash</strong><br /><span><br /><span>I did want to add something about Flash for 2015, it's not going away and its the new must have for any Enterprise Infrastructure, the key to making that decision of having Flash is where do you have it? Does the workload warrant a complete all flash array? or is it just a particular workload that requires some Flash. <br /><span><br /><span>Although the cost is coming down for Enterprise Flash there is still a very small use case for people walking away from traditional spinning disks for some of their workloads. <span><span>I believe we will see a continued increase around Hybrid Arrays, we may also see some very niche use cases for all flash arrays and everything in between won't go away and there will be a use case somewhere. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="/uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/8672817_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:599px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">My last topic that i believe will become even bigger will be the <strong>Converged Infrastructure vs Hyper-Coverged Infrastructure</strong>, even if it was a vs debate. <br /></div>  <span class='imgPusher' style='float:left;height:0px'></span><span style='z-index:10;position:relative;float:left;;clear:left;margin-top:0px;*margin-top:0px'><a><img src="/uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/4039703.png" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px; none;" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder" /></a><span style="display: block; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;" class="wsite-caption"></span></span> <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;display:block;">Converged Infrastructure is an approach to data center management that relies  on a specific vendor and the vendor's partners to provide pre-configured  bundles of hardware and software in a single chassis.<br /><span><br /><span>The key different between Converged Infrastructure and HyperConverged Infrastructure is that it is made up of these building blocks and of which these blocks can be used on their own and not part of the solution when not fully configured. This also means that additional blades, storage etc can be added to the CI during it's lifetime. <br /><span><br /><span>in a HyperConverged Infrastructure the technology is <strong>Software Defined..</strong>.. this means the underlining building blocks cannot be broken. <br /></span></span></span></span></div> <hr style="width:100%;clear:both;visibility:hidden;"></hr>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Duncan Epping from VMware's EVO:RAIL (aka MARVIN) team suggests  that upfront costs for converged systems need to be taken into account  when considering upgrading a company's infrastructure. For  hyper-converged systems, he says integration with existing  infrastructure and figuring out how to manage different platform needs  to be included in the financial considerations as well. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  While many of the vendors that provide components and systems in the  converged market are established vendors, EMC, Cisco, NetApp,  Hewlett-Packard, for example, Epping says, "Some vendors in the  hyper-converged space are relatively new; can you trust them with your  mission-critical workloads?"&nbsp; <br /><br /><span style=""></span>Not all of the companies offering hyper-converged offerings are new,  however. Among the established IT vendors with hyper-converged products  are the aforementioned EMC, Dell, Nutanix and Epping's own VMware.  Though VMware is a bit unique, as Epping explains, "EVO:RAIL is not a  pure VMware offering, it is a partner program that enables customers to  select a hyper-converged offering from their preferred vendor."<br /><span><br /><span></span></span>I believe we will see a lot more around the HyperConverged market, but i don't see a VS here, there are use cases for each option and it's always going to come down to cost vs requirement as it always has. <br /><span><br /><span>From my point of view, the HyperConverged arena worries me slightly. in researching VMware EVO:RAIL it's such a simple solution and with very little need for Professional Services, is this the year if this stuff takes off that Professional Services are the guys that take the hit.... or is there always a place for Consulting services??? <br /><span><br /><span></span></span></span></span>I am excited to see what happens this year in our IT world, in particular the Hybrid Cloud, it's been a buzz word for so long "Cloud" and now there is a realisation of being able to move in and out with no lengthy time frames. If you want to see an interview i did with Richi Jennings at NetApp Insight Berlin 2014 - <a title="" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jR4o0kIwhvc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jR4o0kIwhvc</a> <br /><span><br /><span>I think some other key things to mention for the upcoming year are the following: <br /><span><br /></span></span></span>  &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data Growth continues to accelerate. <br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data dependency place more demands on IT. <br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So many Service Delivery options <br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Massive rate of technology change, new solutions, buzz words and ideas. <br /><span><br /><span><br /><span>I would normally at this stage list off the massive personal Exam &amp; Training plan for the upcoming year, quite frankly this hasn't really changed too much since last year. When i was setting goals i honestly didn't think a new born baby would prevent my study time. I was very wrong abou that prediction. For the year i will be concentrating on my key technologies these will include NetApp, Cisco DC, Veeam, VMware and Microsoft. <br /><span><br /><span>As always if you have any questions then please ping them across. </span></span></span></span></span><br /><span></span>  <!--[if gte mso 9]>        <![endif]--></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="/uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/6173266_orig.jpg" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:770px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div></div><div class='blog-social'><div class='blog-social-item'><a class='twitter-share-button' href='http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvzilla.co.uk%2F1%2Fpost%2F2015%2F03%2F2015-the-year-of-the.html' data-count='horizontal'></a></div><div class='blog-social-item blog-fb-like'><fb:like href='http://vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2015/03/2015-the-year-of-the.html' show_faces='false' layout='button_count' width='90'></fb:like></div><div style='clear:both'></div></div>

<p class='blog-comments'><a href='/1/post/2015/03/february-2015-challenge-completed.html#comments' class='blog-link'>2 Comments</a></p></div><div class='blog-separator'> &nbsp; </div><div class='blog-content'><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">  My challenge set for February was to complete 50 miles over the course of the 28 days. At the beginning of the month after completing the whole of January which totalled 43.86 Miles I thought I had set a milestone just that little too far to reach. <br /> <br /> I was very proud of myself for maintaining the routine for the first 31 days of 2015 that was my biggest challenge and not really the 1 mile a day at least target. As I have said in previous posts relating to these personal challenges I am quite an active person and have played a very good standard of rugby which involves a lot of training both weights and cardio. Before this year though I had never ran continuous for 1 mile, hence the challenge. <br /> <br /> This then brought me onto my next challenge, I have an overall target covering 90 days and this is split up over three monthly challenges. I am hoping off the back of these challenges that some sort of routine is instilled into my lifestyle and I continue to be active on a daily basis. <br /> <br /> Challenge - Complete 50 miles during the month of February! <br /> <br /> Challenge Completed 23/02/2015 - 50.98 Miles completed. <br /> <br /> I will however continue to run for the remaining 5 days of the month and my now small target is to reach the 100 miles completed in 2015 (as of 23/02/2015 it is 94.84) my target all month has been to run 2 miles per day, some days that happened and some days it didn't but there were also days where I completed 2.5 and even one day I completed 3 miles! <br /> <br /> Here is the breakdown of Pace and Distance for both January and February.<br /><!--[if gte mso 9]>        <![endif]--></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="/uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/7142210_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:1009px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">  And now onto my next challenge for March, I plan to complete 2 miles on every day for the month of March. <br /> <br /> #2MileADayMarch15 - Complete at least 2 miles a day in March, 31 days and a minimum target of 62 miles. <br /> <br /> As we are fast approaching Spring over here in the UK the weather although I have been quite lucky will start to brighten up, morning runs will not be dark and gloomy the same as evening as the nights get lighter. My biggest issue is going to be consistently maintaining 2 miles at least every day. With my current pace that is around 22-23 minutes at least I will be out every day. I managed an 11 day streak in February where I managed to complete at least 2 miles a day and a second streak of 7 days which at the time of writing leaves us with another 5 days remaining. <br /> <br /> If I can complete the challenge I will have ran every day for 90 days in 2015, that really makes me want to carry on that routine and hit some other milestones during the year! that's a quarter of the year I have managed to get out of my warm house and run for some amount of time...... <br /> <br /> I would also still like to point out that my JustGiving page is still active for now and if you have some spare cash then please donate, it&rsquo;s for a great cause still. <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/support-us/find-an-event/charity-challenges/dryathlon" title="">http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/support-us/find-an-event/charity-challenges/dryathlon</a><br /> <br /> Below you will find a breakdown of each day the distance I covered and the weekly totals on the right. I will continue to capture this data throughout March also.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <!--[if gte mso 9]>        <![endif]--></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="/uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/3469724_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:952px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="/uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/3453208_orig.jpg" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:420px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div></div><div class='blog-social'><div class='blog-social-item'><a class='twitter-share-button' href='http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvzilla.co.uk%2F1%2Fpost%2F2015%2F03%2Ffebruary-2015-challenge-completed.html' data-count='horizontal'></a></div><div class='blog-social-item blog-fb-like'><fb:like href='http://vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2015/03/february-2015-challenge-completed.html' show_faces='false' layout='button_count' width='90'></fb:like></div><div style='clear:both'></div></div>

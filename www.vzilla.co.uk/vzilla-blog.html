It&rsquo;s seems my content was viewed a lot more as well compared to previous years so much so I decided to summarise the key areas and focus points on the vZilla website. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">How many posts???<br /></h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      The majority of my posts in 2015 were around my key technologies VMware, NetApp, Cisco and Veeam. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    As I said in the introduction I have made an extra effort to contribute within the community and using my blog as well as my twitter and LinkedIn accounts to reach the wider areas. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    You can see from the stats below that the since I started the page in 2013 there has been some steady growth I would like to think I can hit that extra 5-6 posts during 2016 to continue sharing my thoughts and technical findings. <br /><span style=""></span>        </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/489780_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:752px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">Visitor Stats<br /></h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      One thing I did keep an eye on this year are the web site statistics, quite interesting to see the amount of hits and visits that the site took but also the top viewed blog posts. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/8263979_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:884px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      I have since moved over to AWstats for my statistics capture for 2016, looks a little more in depth and much more modern. From the chart above the key stats are the monthly visits, showing May and October, November being the chart topping months. The overall highest visits was 5550 visits and that was from May, May saw a couple of posts one around a release of NetApp OnCommand Shift and also a post around Veeam FastSCP for Microsoft Azure. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">Top 3 Blog Posts<br /></h2>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/3041383.jpg@309" alt="Picture" style="width:auto;max-width:100%" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      Moving onto the most visited blog posts were as follows: <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    1 &ndash; November 13th &ndash; 1562 visits &ndash; Cisco Appliances Post <br /><span style=""></span>2 &ndash; February 26th &ndash; 1525 visits &ndash; FlexPod 101 &amp; OpenStack Fundamentals <br /><span style=""></span>3 &ndash; November 12th &ndash; 1504 visits &ndash; NetApp Insight <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    <a title="" style="" href="http://bit.ly/1jrb6fD">http://bit.ly/1jrb6fD</a> - Cisco &amp; Veeam Appliance &ndash; A Match Made In&hellip;. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <a title="" style="" href="http://bit.ly/1UMg8jf">http://bit.ly/1UMg8jf</a> - FlexPod 101 <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <a title="" style="" href="http://bit.ly/1MWO7EM">http://bit.ly/1MWO7EM</a> - OpenStack Fundamentals<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <a title="" style="" href="http://bit.ly/1k7sk1A">http://bit.ly/1k7sk1A</a> - NetApp Insight 2015 - Las Vegas<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <a title="" style="" href="http://bit.ly/1QktV1r">http://bit.ly/1QktV1r</a> - NetApp Insight 2015 - Berlin<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <a title="" style="" href="http://bit.ly/1OXmTQJ">http://bit.ly/1OXmTQJ</a> - Veeam FastSCP for Microsoft Azure <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <a title="" style="" href="http://bit.ly/1O3UqoB">http://bit.ly/1O3UqoB</a> - AltaVault + Veeam - Backup to the Cloud&hellip; <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <a title="" style="" href="http://bit.ly/1NPIDdD">http://bit.ly/1NPIDdD</a> - Appliances, Appliances Everywhere&hellip; Veeam &amp; NetApp E-Series <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <a title="" style="" href="http://bit.ly/1GJZCgz">http://bit.ly/1GJZCgz</a> - NetApp Storage Snapshots with Veeam <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <a title="" style="" href="http://bit.ly/1IZeCJS">http://bit.ly/1IZeCJS</a> - 2015 A Year in Review<br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">Twitter - @MichaelCade1<br /></h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      It&rsquo;s been another busy year for me on Twitter, but I have so much to thank to the platform, not only is it the best form of research and it is so informative, it works really well to my lifestyle and it allows me to share my content as well as digest others. Having started on twitter in February of 2009 I was a very slow user but soon came to find the great use case for the platform and it was 2015 where I hit the 10,000 tweets and also the 1200 followers mark. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Not to mention the continued advocate programs that I am apart of, without twitter I would not be involved in any. This year saw the addition of the Cisco Champion class of 2015 and I was also accepted in the latter part of the year to the vExpert2015 club. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/183536.png@384" alt="Picture" style="width:auto;max-width:100%" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      One of the top tweets I had this year with well over 250 engagements on twitter and getting a great shout out from @CiscoGeeks after some data centre work that I was carrying out. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/8034146.png@303" alt="Picture" style="width:auto;max-width:100%" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      The final stats I want to share are for the whole year and spread out over the months. Again something I have only started collecting so next year we will get something to compare to but hopefully it&rsquo;s an upward growth. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    3,167 tweets throughout the year &ndash; Just under 9 tweets a day<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  10,728 Twitter profile views &ndash; <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  498k Twitter Impressions &ndash; Impressions explained and why they are important - <a style="" href="https://www.hashtags.org/platforms/twitter/understanding-twitter-impressions-why-are-they-important/">https://www.hashtags.org/platforms/twitter/understanding-twitter-impressions-why-are-they-important/</a> <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    511 new followers &ndash; With the total of followers up to 1,268 that to me seems like some considerable growth in 2015 compared to since 2009. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/995826.png@494" alt="Picture" style="width:auto;max-width:100%" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      Next year I am hoping I can better all of these numbers, but the key to this is sharing with the community, as long as the content I am putting out there is being digested by one or more people then it&rsquo;s worth doing in my opinion. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    One regret possibly I do have for 2015 is announcing the beginning of VDM30in30, that&rsquo;s 30 posts in 30 days, the likelihood of this was very slim given the busy events period during November. I did have a list of posts though well above 30 that I thought would be interesting so that sets us in good stead for 2016. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    I have a content list for 2016 that I will be working through to ensure content is valuable. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div></div><div class='blog-social'><div class='blog-social-item'><a class='twitter-share-button' href='http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvzilla.co.uk%2F1%2Fpost%2F2016%2F01%2Fvzilla-website-social-media-stats.html' data-count='horizontal'></a></div><div class='blog-social-item blog-fb-like'><fb:like href='http://vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2016/01/vzilla-website-social-media-stats.html' show_faces='false' layout='button_count' width='90'></fb:like></div><div style='clear:both'></div></div>

</div><div class='blog-separator'> &nbsp; </div><div class='blog-content'><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      2015 &ndash; A Year in Review<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    My first post of 2016 is going to have a quick look back over 2015, from my own career perspective and also the industry as a whole. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    <strong>Starting with Veeam </strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    At the end of March 2015 I joined the Veeam team and I have not looked back, just short of a year now and I have to say I love it. Vendor land, Pre Sales and systems engineering a year ago was a little unknown to me, having worked in a predominantly post sales capacity it was a big step into the unknown but I knew I wanted to give it a shot and see how I faired. I am really enjoying things and here are some of the things that have stood out for me over the last 10 months. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    <strong>1st Quarter (April &ndash; June)</strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    First thing was to go through the on boarding process, having worked with Veeam before it was a nice advantage to have during the on boarding sessions. I was also very fortunate, that as part of the NetApp A-Team, I was able to visit Sunnyvale for the annual ETL event where the whole team met up and got to hear some insights into what is happening at NetApp over the short and long term. To sum up the first quarter it was more about getting to know my colleagues at Veeam and a lot of finding my feet with the product features and processes. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    <strong>2nd Quarter (July &ndash; September) </strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    This was where the fun really started for me, I have never been in a Sales driven environment before, aiming for numbers and being so close to the sale. This was my first quarter and I have to say, I loved it! Delivering demos and proof of concepts to end users and seeing it through from the initial meeting to a PO was a great feeling. One of the biggest deals I was involved with was for a UK Service Provider, they were refreshing their existing Infrastructure as a Service offering with Veeam Cloud Connect and becoming a Veeam VCSP partner. I was involved from start to finish from a technical aspect, seeing this come to fruition was a great milestone for me. To top this quarter off, I received the MVP award within the UK SE team which was a great surprise and honour after only being with Veeam 6 months. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    <strong>3rd Quarter (September &ndash; December) </strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    My third quarter saw the events season. Again something I have not been involved with from this side of the fence I have been to many events as a technical person but not actually speaking or on stand duty. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Veeam ON Tour &ndash; Here I was given the chance to co present with my manager at all four events! Live demos would have been our preference but due to some flaky internet connections, we had to fall back on the canned demos I had prepared. The four locations for 2015 were Manchester, London, Edinburgh and Dublin. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    NetApp Insight, Las Vegas &ndash; Again, I was fortunate to visit the annual US event in Las Vegas hosted by NetApp, as part of the NetApp A-Team. Here I not only took on the technical sessions but also took part in other media opportunities. A real highlight was &ldquo;Engineers Unplugged&rdquo; with Cisco alongside my Veeam colleague, Shawn Lieu. This is yet to be published, I&rsquo;ll link when this comes online to view!<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    NetApp Insight, Berlin EMEA &ndash; Stand Duty &ndash; I have been to many Insight conferences but until 2015 had never done &ldquo;stand duty&rdquo;, so this was new to me but I really enjoyed it! I managed to get to some technical sessions on the first day and in between stand duty, I was also able to get involved in some advocate tasks. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    IP Expo, London &ndash; This is another regular event for me, but again never on stand duty or as a guest speaker. This was a totally new experience for me, having a speaking slot was a great and I expect there will be many more in 2016! <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    With all this going on I still had a pre-sales job to do, so this meant a lot of time away from my family, scheduling meetings in and around these events. With the feature announcements throughout the year of version 9, we were also busy with What&rsquo;s new demos etc. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    All in all, 3 great quarters with Veeam and I have a feeling it&rsquo;s only going to get better and better going into 2016; My calendar is already getting quite packed with meetings, conferences and events. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    <strong>Review 2015 predictions &ndash; </strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    At the start of 2015 I followed suit with what seemed to be the entire tech industry, creating prediction blogs for the year ahead, here is the link to that blog - <a style="" href="1/post/2015/03/2015-the-year-of-the.html">http://vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2015/03/2015-the-year-of-the.html</a><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    &ldquo;The continuance growth of adoption to Hybrid Cloud&rdquo; <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    I am not going to get into detail about each prediction but I think the continuance of Hybrid Cloud adoption did continue but probably not at the speed I and others though for 2015. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    &ldquo;Flexibility will be the biggest issue facing the storage industry&rdquo; <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Flexibility, again goes hand in hand with the hybrid cloud adoption and being able to easily move data in and out and all around different environments. I believe the tools are growing in maturity and it&rsquo;s now down to the end users to embrace and start leveraging this technology. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    &ldquo;Software Defined &hellip;&rdquo; <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    I think in my opinion this is an area where there as been a lot of hype around Software Defined but quite little traction and user take up. The biggest one for me this year was around Software Defined Networking and understanding at a very 101 level what this was doing and how this was abstracting the physical network. Again an Industry buzz word that I am sure will continue to be branded in 2016. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    &ldquo;Flash&rdquo; <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    One thing I mentioned at the beginning of 2015 was &ldquo;we may also see some very niche use cases for all flash arrays and everything in between won't go away and there will be a use case somewhere.&rdquo; I think this area has moved on quite a lot in 2015, mostly around the All Flash vendors gaining some good traction and the price point of SSD over spinning disks greatly being reduced along with capacity enhancements also assisting in that area of adoption. Is it the end of spinning disk? No that stuff is not going away just yet&hellip; think tape that hasn&rsquo;t and nor will spinning disk there is always a use case. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>        &ldquo;Converged Infrastructure Vs Hyper-Converged Infrastructure&rdquo; <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    I believe this area hasn&rsquo;t moved as quickly as expected I think the larger storage vendors have realised that &ldquo;simplicity&rdquo; is something that customers want to see and have within their infrastructure and this bolted onto any infrastructure be it storage, compute and networking. HCI isn&rsquo;t going away and there is still very much a market for this type of infrastructure, from my experience though I have been involved in very few HCI projects where as there is still a strong presence of converged infrastructure, I would probably change the vs to or though there is a use case for both as I said. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    <strong>TechOntap Podcast </strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    To top of this great year, I was also invited to guest speak on the NetApp Tech Ontap podcast &ndash; Episode 14 &ldquo;Protecting Your Data with SnapMirror to Everything&rdquo; - <a style="" href="https://soundcloud.com/techontap_podcast/episode-14-protecting-your-data-with-snapmirror-to-everything">https://soundcloud.com/techontap_podcast/episode-14-protecting-your-data-with-snapmirror-to-everything</a> It was a great privilege to be asked onto the podcast, I have listened to this podcast since day one and been very much advocating the podcast alongside everything else that NetApp have been doing over the years. Hopefully I didn&rsquo;t do a bad job and they will have me back on to discuss some more data protection or integrations with Veeam soon. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>            </div></div><div class='blog-social'><div class='blog-social-item'><a class='twitter-share-button' href='http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvzilla.co.uk%2F1%2Fpost%2F2016%2F01%2F2015-a-year-in-review.html' data-count='horizontal'></a></div><div class='blog-social-item blog-fb-like'><fb:like href='http://vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2016/01/2015-a-year-in-review.html' show_faces='false' layout='button_count' width='90'></fb:like></div><div style='clear:both'></div></div>

It will be my first time at an Insight event where I have been a &ldquo;booth babe&rdquo; <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    I am really looking forward to the event and I do have some free time to attend some sessions whilst there, the schedule I have selected is outlined below, my main aim is to gather any revision material I can around the new exam sets that NetApp have recently released. Another reason for me really looking forward to attending is the Alliance partnership between NetApp &amp; Veeam is in a great place at the moment with some really great features that were released by Veeam last November in version 8 and coming in version 9 we have more dedicated features released for NetApp. It&rsquo;s going to be great catching up with my peers and giving them the deep dive into what we do and how we can help&hellip;.&nbsp; <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">My Schedule<br /></h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      Previous years I have posted a mix of different sessions that I have scheduled to attend whilst at the conference. Given my role change since last year my focus is more around the Data Protection piece, so really interested in what is coming from NetApp around this area such as SnapCenter, AltaVault and E-Series. After hearing some of the announcements about &ldquo;SnapMirror to Everything&rdquo; I am also very keen to hear more about how this can help the Alliance between Veeam and NetApp further. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    You will also see a lot of Exam preparation sessions for each of the new exam sets that have been introduced earlier in the year. These are something I would like to see and hear so that when the time comes I will have some preparation in place for my revision. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/8396003_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:569px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">Things to see in Berlin.... <br /></h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      <strong>Olympic Stadium </strong>&ndash; for those that attended Insight in Berlin last year the NetApp EMEA event was held here and it was a very impressive venue, the event is not going to be held there this year but if you do have some free time be sure to visit. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/910875_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:1100px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      <strong>Classic Remise Berlin</strong> - If you love cars then this is well worth the visit, it&rsquo;s free and there are a lot of old rare and expensive cars here.

To set the scene here is a brief overview of the product portfolio as it was purchased by NetApp in November 2014 by a good friend of mine @JK47theweapon&nbsp; -&nbsp; <a style="" href="http://www.jk-47.com/2015/05/netapp-altavault-speeding-up-cutting-costs-and-cloudify-your-backups/">http://www.jk-47.com/2015/05/netapp-altavault-speeding-up-cutting-costs-and-cloudify-your-backups/</a> <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    In the same way I have touched on the DAS and SAN approach with the for mentioned &ldquo;Appliances&rdquo; I wanted to put a case over as to why AltaVault is a great fit for your backup infrastructure with Veeam. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">                      <strong style="" "mso-bidi-font-weight:="" normal"="">What is AltaVault </strong><br /><span style=""></span>      </h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      Well AltaVault is a &ldquo;Cloud Integrated Storage&rdquo; device. Some physical disk in your location but it&rsquo;s then able to upload data of a specific criteria up to many different &ldquo;Cloud&rdquo; environments. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    The local physical disk is presented out over NAS protocols so that can be either SMB or NFS this is presented to your backup media server and this is where the backups are pointed to within the job. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Storage efficiencies are a big factor when it comes to the modern data center. The real estate cost for shelves and shelves of storage is expensive in any case, So when sizing any backup solutions and in an ideal situation you are only keeping the changes since the last incremental meaning new data or even if we are wanting to keep more and more full backups we can do in leveraging global storage efficiencies. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    The AltaVault range uses inline deduplication and compression, this is on a global front as well not on a per volume level as per the NetApp FAS or on a per backup job from Veeam. That&rsquo;s an important point., Another important thing to mention is the ability to encrypt your data at rest and in flight. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/6691445_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:415px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      <strong>Platforms and Sizing </strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    NetApp today have two physical AltaVault appliances and several capacity based virtual appliances. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Another point to mention here before getting into the Technical specifications is the modes in which are available on the AltaVault system. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Backup Mode &ndash; Local backup mode is used when you want to store some backup files and data locally within the customer/end user DC. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  Cold Storage Mode &ndash; Only Metadata is stored locally the rest is stored directly into a cloud provider. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Below I am only going to mention the Backup Mode because restore speeds I feel would not be acceptable given where I am positioning this as a solution. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Physical Appliances - <a style="" href="http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3687.pdf">http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3687.pdf</a> <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/6321976_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:699px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      Virtual Appliances - <a style="" href="http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3689.pdf">http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3689.pdf</a> <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/6709099_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:699px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      *The above figures were taken from NetApp.Com nothing has been tested by myself, although in the process of sourcing some equipment. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><ul><li>    Integrates with Veeam Software as an NFS or SMB share. </li><li>  Deduplicates.

I have said it many times before and will continue to say it&hellip; Cloud adoption will be off the back of Backup As A Service or Disaster Recovery As A Service in my opinion this will drive to further adoption in other areas. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/5510867_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:556px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">                      Things to take into consideration <br /><span style=""></span>      </h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><ul><li>                      Do not perform reverse incremental or synthetic full backups </li><li> Disable compression. Encryption and deduplication on the Veeam backup job to avoid unrequired resource usage. </li><li> Set the load control on the AltaVault Management to Control Operations. This will allow Veeam to maximize throughput. </li><li> Limit the use of vPower features to physical AltaVault appliances. * </li></ul><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    *The vPower operations is something I did want to mention here, from a Veeam perspective this is how we present the backup data back into the hypervisor and bring a virtual machine backup and running within a matter of minutes. Because of the nature of the storage on an AltaVault I am unsure the speed of performance we would get from this. This is something I hope to research and add at a later date. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">                      Conclusion <br /><span style=""></span>      </h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      That&rsquo;s three posts and three scenarios where Veeam + DAS, SAN and NAS (Cloud Integrated) can be used as a backup repository. &nbsp;Whilst writing this and after many discussions I have since seen an argument to if this Cloud Integrated storage is a way of removing tape from the eco system&hellip; <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Possibly another post for the month of November to look deeper into that opinion as I know a lot of people on both sides of the fence. <br /><span><br /><span>A worthwhile link for you if looking at this solution would be the Technical Report from NetApp available if you have access to the NetApp Field Portal - TR4426-0515</span></span><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Once again if you have any questions or feedback please reach out on Twitter / Linkedin <br /><span style=""></span>      </div></div><div class='blog-social'><div class='blog-social-item'><a class='twitter-share-button' href='http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvzilla.co.uk%2F1%2Fpost%2F2015%2F11%2Faltavault-veeam-backup-to-the-cloud.html' data-count='horizontal'></a></div><div class='blog-social-item blog-fb-like'><fb:like href='http://vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2015/11/altavault-veeam-backup-to-the-cloud.html' show_faces='false' layout='button_count' width='90'></fb:like></div><div style='clear:both'></div></div>

Well during the month of November on each of the 30 days a new blog post is created, there is no fix on what these should be about there can be and have been a range of personal and technical posts come out during the month. If you want to know more then <a title="" href="http://vmiss.net/writing/vdm30in30-is-coming-qa-inside/">here</a> are some questions and answers from Melissa Palmer a fellow member of the NetApp A-Team and she can write..... over 22k words last year is some effort. <br /><span><br /><span>I am already late to the game which isn't the best start for this but I am confident I can catch up.... I have a few events during the month of November which is either going to really assist on new topics to write about or it's just not going to happen. <br /><span><br /><span><span>So already the 4th of the month, I have this post plus a technical post that is also being posted today. My feelings though about producing content is that it needs to be interesting. Something that @vMiss33 managed last November every single post was well written and very informative. So with that in mind I would much rather get 20 posts out or 10 posts that help people or inform people rather than writing about something that's not. <br /><span><br /><span>From my point of view I am not much of a writer... I think I have some great ideas around blog posts but it\s generally a time thing to sit down and create that idea in writing. </span></span></span></span></span><br /><span></span></span></span></span></span></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/1297289_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:300px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Something else to add in this post is as well as this challenge I have also started the #BeardedHeroes challenge. To give a little background to this the #BeardedHeroes campaign was formed by The Anaphylaxis Campaign. <br /><span><br /><span>This challenge comprises of growing a beard.... not too hard for someone that is pretty lazy when it comes to facial hair tidyness. but none the less I signed up, normally this would be for the month of December, I felt that would be a very normal month for me so I decided to begin on the 25th October where I already had a good healthy showing of facial beardness. The rules do not state that I had to be clean shaven so I just started then and here we are 9 days on. <br /><span><br /><span>N<span></span>ormally around this time of year I would take part in the Movember phenomenon, however this year I decided to go for something different. </span><span>A little background onthis charity, <br /><span><br /><span></span></span>"</span></span></span></span>Anaphylaxis Campaign is the only UK wide charity to exclusively meet  the needs of the growing numbers of people at risk from severe allergic  reactions (anaphylaxis) by providing information and support relating to  foods and other triggers such as latex, drugs and insect stings."<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span> <span>Now the why this charity... just over a year ago pretty much to the day of the 25th October my son was around 6 months old and my wife and I were weaning Jack on all the different new foods in particular we took clear notice of the mid wives advice around separating the different allergens for each feed. Well came the day when we had been through the majority of the allergens we had done the Wheat, Gluten etc but we had not tried Peanut, Tree nuts or Egg. Thinking there should be no problem as we have no background in our families with allergies we proceeded with the peanut testing.... I can safely say that it was the scariest experience so far in my life! within 5 minutes Jack was swelling up and struggling to breathe what we know now as an </span>anaphylatic<span> shock. I was holding Jack for the duration trying to calm him down whilst we waited for an ambulance. It seemed like a lifetime for the ambulance to arrive but it was under 10 minutes, they issued Jack with some adrenaline and then they took him into hospital where he stayed the night. <br /><span><br /><span>A year on from that Jack has not had any other shocks, fully tested on 98% of all Tree nuts and Egg and all diary have also been fine as well as seafood. We now carry two Epi-Pens wherever we go with Jack just in case a reaction was to happen whilst out. <br /><span><br /><span></span></span>The amount of information that we simply did not know about allergies, intolerances and </span></span></span>anaphylaxis was scary, this charity amongst many other parents and sufferers across the world with their blog pages and articles on the matter was priceless to me and my wife. understanding safe food suppliers and all the rulings. <br /><span><br /><span>I wanted to do something to help not only raise money for this great charity but also raise awareness of this... anaphylaxis is a killer its not an allergy and its not an intolerance and it certainly isn't a fashion statement. I for one want to make this world the safest place for my son to grow up in, I don't want any new parents to have to experience what I did on that night. <br /><span><br /><span>I could have easily made this two posts and made my month a lot easier but maybe I will dedicate another post just to this topic later on in the month. <br /><span><br /><span>One final note on this is if you can spare any money for this charity then please donate to </span></span></span></span></span></span>                      <a style="" href="https://www.justgiving.com/Michael-Cade/">https://www.justgiving.com/Michael-Cade/</a> <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>      Hopefully you find the next 30 posts interesting and learn something from them, please comment away or reach out on twitter always happy to help or chime in on anything. <br /> </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/5375747_orig.jpg" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:236px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div></div><div class='blog-social'><div class='blog-social-item'><a class='twitter-share-button' href='http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvzilla.co.uk%2F1%2Fpost%2F2015%2F11%2Fa-little-late-to-the-game-vdm30in30.html' data-count='horizontal'></a></div><div class='blog-social-item blog-fb-like'><fb:like href='http://vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2015/11/a-little-late-to-the-game-vdm30in30.html' show_faces='false' layout='button_count' width='90'></fb:like></div><div style='clear:both'></div></div>

</div><div class='blog-separator'> &nbsp; </div><div class='blog-content'><h2 style="text-align:left;">Introduction<br /></h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      A few weeks back I put a post together around the Cisco UCS C class high density storage and server and how it really works as an ideal Veeam appliance in some scenarios, as part of this series I wanted to choose a SAN based appliance as well as next touching on a Cloud Integrated solution which will be coming up shortly. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span>You can find the post regarding the Cisco UCS C Class Appliance here - </span>                      <a style="" href="http://bit.ly/1jrb6fD">http://bit.ly/1jrb6fD</a> <br /><span></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Firstly, I chose for the SAN appliance post to talk about the NetApp E-Series range, the E-Series offers a high performance backup repository for us as Veeam to store out backup files.&nbsp; This coupled with the high density of storage and the performance of recovery from an enterprise level storage array provides a great story as to why the E-Series is a great fit for a SAN based Veeam repository. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">NetApp E-Series Product Description<br /></h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      NetApp have two streams or products within the E-Series portfolio that being the E-Series and the EF-Series for the purpose of this post I am going to touch only on the E-Series purely because it is quite unrealistic but not unheard of for end users to require an all flash array for backup purposes. However, the EF-Series has the same SANtricity OS as the E-Series range so all points in the post are still relevant to that. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">E2700 &amp; E5600<br /></h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      Both SAN storage arrays with connectivity options of FC, iSCSI or SAS. Both scale up from a capacity point of view by adding additional disk shelves. The options around disks from a controller and storage point of view are 2U with 12 disks or 4U with 60 disks. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    The E-Series family uses a lightweight operating system / management software called SANtricity. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><ul><li>    Dynamic Drive rebalancing</li><li>RAID Management </li><li>  Intelligent Cache Tiering </li><li>  Data Replication </li></ul><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    I have listed some key features below for the NetApp E-Series and some value add that you may not get from other SAN based backup targets. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    I have mentioned the High density storage meaning less physical estate or rack requirements for a large capacity storage solution, this also brings reduced power and cooling requirements. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Another key feature of the E-Series array is the Dynamic Disk Pools (DDP) this technical feature enables the dynamic rebalancing of drives, allowing for an easy way of growing capacity whilst also providing disk level protection if a drive was to fail. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  The final feature I am going to mention is the Disk Encryption, an enterprise feature within the storage array market and sometimes a requirement for all tiers of backup storage. The ability to encrypt at the drive level using the AES 128BIT algorithm plus simplified key management provides that level of security without an impact on performance.&nbsp; <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    There are several other features within the E-Series range but when it comes to the SAN Appliance the ones I have mentioned above are the key differentiators that I see against the competitors. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    <strong>E27** </strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    RAW capacity = 1.2PB <br /><span style=""></span>  Max Number of Drives = 192<br /><span style=""></span>    E2712 = 2U / 12 Drives <br /><span style=""></span>  E2724 = 2U / 24 Drives (SAS/SDD options only not NL-SAS) <br /><span></span>                      E2760 = 4U / 60 Drives (NL-SAS, SAS, SDD options available) <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/656948_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:478px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/4077898_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:488px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/1865177_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:899px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      <strong><span style="">E56** </span></strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span></span>                      RAW capacity =&nbsp;

NetApp E-Series<br /></h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      In this section I will bring the reasoning behind why these two technologies are a good fit together. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">                      <font size="2"><strong style="">Backup &amp;

My next post regarding the cloud integrated appliance may have a better use case as the Archive piece. It really depends on the data you are backing up and where the locality of that data needs to be as to which solution works. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">                      <font size="2"><strong style="">Off Premises Backup / Replication target </strong></font><br /><span style=""></span>      </h2>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/3937842_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:975px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      Another scenario where the E-Series may fit is in an already FAS for production storage scenario much the same as the first scenario but with Veeam ability to talk to the underlying NetApp FAS storage API the backup window is greatly reduced as well as the hit on the production vSphere environment. The big thing to note here is by leveraging the E-Series as the primary backup storage you are not using the same hardware, but from a support perspective you are able to speak to the same technical support for all storage related issues. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Veeam replication jobs can also be used here for fast disaster recovery SLAs without the requirement of expensive DR storage systems. A Veeam Backup Copy job can then be used for an offsite backup to another E-Series device. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">                      <strong style="">Benefits of Veeam &amp; NetApp E-Series</strong><br /><span style=""></span>      </h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      The fundamental reason that the NetApp E-Series is a great fit for a backup repository is because of the storage performance, the restore capabilities from Veeam are greatly improved when the storage system can deal with those operations in a fast and timely manner. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    The restore capabilities with the E-Series and Veeam the ability to leverage the backup data to perform verification tasks and to bring up a virtual environment for testing purposes is a huge plus for this storage system acting as a backup repository.&nbsp; <br /><span style=""></span>      </div></div><div class='blog-social'><div class='blog-social-item'><a class='twitter-share-button' href='http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvzilla.co.uk%2F1%2Fpost%2F2015%2F11%2Fappliances-appliances-everywhere-veeam-and-netapp-e-series-backup-appliance.html' data-count='horizontal'></a></div><div class='blog-social-item blog-fb-like'><fb:like href='http://vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2015/11/appliances-appliances-everywhere-veeam-and-netapp-e-series-backup-appliance.html' show_faces='false' layout='button_count' width='90'></fb:like></div><div style='clear:both'></div></div>

I am extremely fortunate to be able to attend both conferences. As part of the NetApp A-Team, in Las Vegas not only were we able to get to the General Sessions or the Technical breakouts but we were also &nbsp;able to network with some of our peers, within NetApp, that we may only get to communicate over email with that are. Alongside this we got to take part in certain press events and also the illustrious Tech ONTAP Podcast with Glenn Sizemore, Pete Flecha and Andrew Sullivan. The Berlin event will be a little different for me as I will be attending in a vendor role so although there will be A-Team activities I will mostly be spending my time on the Veeam booth. <br /></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/185281_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:946px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                        The reason for the post is to outline the announcements and &nbsp;where possible highlight some of the new features and enhancements that are coming in the NetApp portfolio. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;"><a style="" title="" href="http://www.dragndropbuilder.com/editor/main.php#">Day One Announcements </a><span></span><br /></h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      The NetApp Data Fabric was still the main topic at this year&rsquo;s event. These announcements were geared toward the Hybrid Cloud model and how &nbsp;NetApp technology could be used to leverage between &nbsp;Private and Public cloud offering to improve a whole variety of things for particular customers. The first announcements &nbsp;this day was &nbsp;around the following:&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Data Fabric Solution Essentials &ndash; starter kits &nbsp;that allow the customer to become hybrid cloud ready. Kits include three offerings: Accelerating Applications, Gaining Control of Shadow IT and Disaster Recovery Improvements.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> The following are the titled kits available today to begin the data fabric journey: <br /><ul><li> Application Acceleration Solution Kit </li><li> OpenStack Solution Kit </li><li> Snap-To-Cloud DR Solution Kit </li></ul> They also announced how they will be offering enablement services for the above kits &nbsp;to assist customers in bring the data fabric to fruition.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> These services are broken down into four offerings: <br /><ul><li>    Cloud Sourcing Strategy Workshop </li><li>  Service Catalog Design </li><li>  Service Platform Design </li><li>  NetApp Private Storage for Cloud Implementation Service </li></ul><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>      NetApp also announced that they had become a Google Cloud Platform Technology Partner.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> There were also announcements around improvements for Cloud ONTAP software with increased data security, volume capacity increases and other enhancements.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> NetApp also announced some enhanced security capabilities for the NetApp AltaVault range. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/7383497_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:640px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;"><a style="" title="" href="http://www.dragndropbuilder.com/editor/main.php#">Day Two Announcements </a></h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The announcements of day two were very much aligned to the partners, enabling them to assist their customers in moving to this hybrid cloud model.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> The most notable takeaway from this session was the partner specialization programs being made available by NetApp that will be used to increase partners knowledge and capabilities.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Anyone that has been involved with NetApp technologies over the past year or longer will know the pain points around transitioning from a 7mode system to a new Clustered ONTAP solution. Announced was a new training program aligned to enable the transition, called &ldquo;Clustered Data ONTAP transition services&rdquo;.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> The second specialization was the Clustered Data ONTAP specialization and this is the enabler to size, sell and architect NetApp solutions.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> On Day Two, we also got to see from Neto from Brazil who is a new member of the NetApp A-Team in a Technical Advisor capacity. This was the first real INSIGHT into what was happening from a technical release point of view. (I have linked the session in the additional resources section below.)&nbsp;<br /> <br /> The demo consisted of a SQL database stored in a NetApp on premises system and then replicated to an off premises NetApp Private Storage system (NPS).<br /> <br /> The database was consistently snapshotted (notice how I didn&rsquo;t use the term backup) with a new product from NetApp called SnapCenter andthe database instance was connected to an Amazon Web Services EC2 compute instance. It was also spun across to Microsoft Azure where Neto from Brazil failed between the cloud providers with NO DOWNTIME.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> The next interesting thing to see was the beta version of Cloud ONTAP running inside of Azure&hellip; and being able to migrate between a hosted database in AWS over to an Azure instance.&nbsp;<br /> <a style=""><br /><!--[if gte mso 9]>        <![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-GB   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                                                             <![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]>   /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:"Table Normal"; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-parent:""; 	mso-padding-alt:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin-top:0cm; 	mso-para-margin-right:0cm; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:8.0pt; 	mso-para-margin-left:0cm; 	line-height:107%; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-language:EN-US;}  <![endif]-->  </a>Given my role, I could probably steer clear of SnapCenter and not mention however, for intense and purposes I will give my opinion. This is a v1 product release from NetApp, where today only SQL is supported and I believe soon to be the virtual infrastructure. I can only imagine the roadmap consists of all the existing SnapManager range as well as more , with the integration to the SnapCreator framework there is very little that this new product shouldn&rsquo;t be able to pick up. Without going to technical into this because I simply have not seen, I believe the SnapDrive agent is still deployed albeit through a central management server. I believe there also may be another agent similar but slim version of the SnapManager agent. So you still have that overhead of managing those agents however from one single central management server.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <a style=""><span><br /><span></span></span></a>Interested to hear more about this product and where NetApp are heading with the whole Data Protection piece.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> There was also a lot of hype about the NetApp All Flash FAS.Rightly so, Neto from Brazil, albeit using a canned demo, proved that an AFF cluster could achieve above 1.1million IOPS without any downtime or disruption to service. <br /><span style=""></span>        </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/8467689_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:979px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                        In watching the demo video again, I noticed a hidden message.

More agile and less complex is that way everything should be going in our industry. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  With the scale out architecture from both Veeam and Cisco UCS this really does move with the enterprise future requirements. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <h2 style="text-align:left;">UCS C3260<br /></h2>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      During the writing of this post the Cisco UCS C3260 was released, this platform offers a dual server node compared to the one node in the C3160, this basically means you can share the workload between the two nodes, all drives are available to to both server nodes. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    This system uses the same chassis as the C3160 however you can only have a total of 56 drives to accommodate the second server node. <br /><span style=""></span>      </div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/5634583_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:718px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">                      From a Veeam standpoint the C3260 with it&rsquo;s two server nodes are an ideal solution, One server node can act as the Veeam Backup &amp; Replication server, this will include Management, Proxy and Repository. The second node can be used for Veeam ONE, Enterprise Manager and WAN acceleration.

<p class='blog-comments'><a href='1/post/2015/07/netgear-readynas-312-review.html#comments' class='blog-link'>9 Comments</a></p></div><div class='blog-separator'> &nbsp; </div><div class='blog-content'><div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><strong>           Introduction </strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  My initial use case for the NETGEAR 312 was for simple home usage, I wanted a NAS to store my documents, photo libraries and some other media. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    But given my profession I could also see a use case where I could leverage the iSCSI / NFS protocols to present storage to my virtual environment for both a production storage layer but also leverage as target backup storage. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Throughout my review I will be touching on the SMB protocol for my documents &amp; media and I will also be touching on the NFS and iSCSI for use in a VMware environment. <br /><span style=""></span><strong><br /><span style=""></span>    Setup &amp; Usage Impressions </strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Today I received my new ReadyNAS 312, I have installed two 1TB drives, these are configured in a RAID 1 group (mirrored copy) this gives me the protection if one of those drives were to fail I would still have access to my data. If protection wasn&rsquo;t a required feature then you are able to change to various different Raid Levels for performance I would expect on this model you would look to use RAID 0 for more information here are a list of available options -<a title="" style="" href="http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22808/related/1">http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22808/related/1</a><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Out of the box I added the two drives connected the power supply and supplied Ethernet cable and powered on the system, out of the box my router gave the ReadyNAS an IP address and also given the UPNP configuration was configured I was able to see the device from my Windows desktop. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    I obtained the DHCP address given to the ReadyNAS and used my browser to connect to the system, I was first prompted with a username and password of which this was username: admin and password: password, I think this is pretty standard with all NETGEAR products and in my opinion I really like that it means out of the box it's easy to get something up and running without running around trying to find the default credentials. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    From entering the above details I was then put into the initial configuration, there are 6 pages to this configuration step, this involves setting language, date and time, hostname, notifications and changing that default password. From there you are shown a system overview page that consists of the device details around serial number and status, it also gives a nice usage diagram so you can see the usage stats. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    At the top of the screen there are a number of tab links to different configurations. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    System - This tab gives you the overview of the system as well as diving into the volumes created, system performance, settings, logs and power options. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Shares - Out of the box there are a number of default shares available, obviously you can create new shares here also, but a great feature that I really like here is&nbsp; the time line feature, here you can see when data has been written to specific shared folders.&nbsp; All NFS and SMB shares can be created here. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    iSCSI - Even though the device is a "ReadyNAS" we also still get the iSCSI block based SAN feature and the iSCSI is where we can create a new LUN to present to our hosts for SAN connectivity. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Accounts - as the tab name implies this is where you can easily create new user accounts for the device. You are also able to leverage an Active Directory domain here as well for authentication. Which is great if using within a small business, I also have my lab demo domain that I will be looking to use as an authentication method. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Network - On the 312 there are two 1Gbps connections available, these can be bonded to avoid any failures or to increase the throughput, there are a number of teaming modes available here, and once again is very simple to configure. Bare in mind though that the management interface you are connected on is also using one of these connections. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Apps - There is a marketplace type function here where there are a number of different applications you can install on top of the ReadyNAS platform, these range from FTP functions to Media Servers, one media server I was glad to see what the "Plex Media Server" having used this application in the past it is a great way of streaming content from your NAS down to a smart TV or other computers on the same LAN. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Cloud - The cloud tab is really great for such product, being able to replicate content to another ReadyNAS is almost an Enterprise feature in itself. ReadyCLOUD something I have not heard of before but looks interesting and provides the ability of being able to access your ReadyNAS from anywhere in the world. Something I will be sure to take a look at. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Backup - The Backup tab offers the ability to either make a local backup but also to set-up a replication job to backup onto a different system (this doesn&rsquo;t need to be another ReadyNAS) another option within this tab another thing that caught my eye was the ability to be able to backup to Dropbox, the ReadyNAS can act as another device to sync your Dropbox files with. <br /><span style=""></span><strong><br /><span style=""></span>      Single Client Performance - CIFS on Windows </strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    I ran some simple file copy operations on my standard Windows laptop running Windows 8.1 with a 1GB/s connection and a file copy to the ReadyNAS was hitting on average 96 MB/s and copying from the ReadyNAS CIFS share I was seeing 55 MB/s, obviously this could be dependant on my network although I know very little was happening other than this but I would expect this performance most of the time. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    I saw a very similar number when it came to both NFS and iSCSI, virtual machines in VMware seemed to be running without any issues at all, moving machines back and fourth between another storage datastore and this one caused no lag or performance issues on the virtual machine. <br /><span style=""></span><strong><br /><span style=""></span>    Miscellaneous aspects and final words </strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    All in all it&rsquo;s a great Home NAS, not everyone looking for a home NAS is going to have the same requirements as myself and will just want the ability to store files maybe backups and leverage this data to move into a cloud based storage option such as Dropbox, the ReadyNAS has this and more, the ability to then stream media around your home is another great benefit without very much configuration or difficulty is a huge plus in my opinion. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>      </div></div><div class='blog-social'><div class='blog-social-item'><a class='twitter-share-button' href='http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvzilla.co.uk%2F1%2Fpost%2F2015%2F07%2Fnetgear-readynas-312-review.html' data-count='horizontal'></a></div><div class='blog-social-item blog-fb-like'><fb:like href='http://vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2015/07/netgear-readynas-312-review.html' show_faces='false' layout='button_count' width='90'></fb:like></div><div style='clear:both'></div></div>

This means you can actually now customize the login page with Veeam backgrounds.<br />&nbsp;<br />It's not supported by VMware, but for home lab it&rsquo;s a great add on and custom way of displaying more company marketing. But because of this you may wish to backup the following files to ensure you can roll back if you need to do so.<br />&nbsp;<br />There are two specific files that you will want to take a look at, the first is unpentry.jsp which controls the look and feel of the actual login page and the second is login.css which controls the stylesheet for the login page.<br />&nbsp;<br />This can be customised on both the Windows version of Virtual Center as well as the appliance, below you will find the file locations of the specific files you need to change in order to achieve our custom login screen.<br />&nbsp;<br />Windows vCenter Server 6.0<br />&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\ProgramData\VMware\vCenterServer\runtime\VMwareSTSService\webapps\websso\WEB-INF\views\unpentry.jsp<br />&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\ProgramData\VMware\vCenterServer\runtime\VMwareSTSService\webapps\websso\resources\css\login.css<br />&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\ProgramData\VMware\vCenterServer\runtime\VMwareSTSService\webapps\websso\resources\img<br />VCSA 6.0<br />&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /usr/lib/vmware-sso/vmware-sts/webapps/websso/WEB-INF/views/unpentry.jsp<br />&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /usr/lib/vmware-sso/vmware-sts/webapps/websso/resources/css/login.css<br />&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /usr/lib/vmware-sso/vmware-sts/webapps/websso/resources/img<br />&nbsp;<br />There is a change required to the login.css to point to your new background picture, find this line of code and change appropriately, your new image should be stored the /resources/img location.<br />&nbsp;<br />background-image: url(../../resources/img/newimagename.jpg)<br />&nbsp;<br />You will also need to edit the unpentry.jsp file and edit a line out find the following line and just put // in front which will stop this from being loaded.<br />&nbsp;<br />//document.write("&lt;img id=\"topSplash\" src=\"../../resources/img/AppBgPattern.png\"/&gt;");<br />&nbsp;<br />Screen shot below shows my first attempt<br />&nbsp;<span><span></span></span><br /></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/3/9/3239227/4028283_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:100%;max-width:1100px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I have also attached the required files to accomplish this in your own demo lab. <br /><br />https://github.com/MichaelCade/SingleSignOn <br /><br />I  got the idea to create this not only since moving to Veeam and wanting  to add something different to my home lab environment for demo's but the  idea and how to came from William Lam @lamw <br /><span><br /><span>Any questions then please drop me a line, any ideas that you might, and feel free to take for your own Veeam demo labs. <br /><span><br /><span>Thanks<br /></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class='blog-social'><div class='blog-social-item'><a class='twitter-share-button' href='http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvzilla.co.uk%2F1%2Fpost%2F2015%2F07%2Fveeam-vsphere-60-single-sign-on-branded.html' data-count='horizontal'></a></div><div class='blog-social-item blog-fb-like'><fb:like href='http://vzilla.co.uk/1/post/2015/07/veeam-vsphere-60-single-sign-on-branded.html' show_faces='false' layout='button_count' width='90'></fb:like></div><div style='clear:both'></div></div>
